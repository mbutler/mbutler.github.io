first, a testimonial:

""A little over two years ago I was a pathetic slob.  I had no money, friends or a future.  Every night I’d set my alarm for 9:00 AM desperately hoping that tomorrow was finally going to be the day I’d drag my lazy ass out of bed in a timely fashion and actually do something with myself.  Then, without fail, I’d snooze 12 times and then give up, sleeping until the middle of the afternoon.  Eventually I’d manage to shuffle into the bathroom to empty my bladder.  Maybe I’d brush my teeth and shower, but most likely I wouldn’t.  Buying groceries was too much of a chore so I’d usually scrape together whatever money I could find for fast food.  And no matter how broke I was I always found money for cigarettes.
I had a million things I wanted to do with my life but not a drop of ambition or drive to get them done.  Bills were always piling up, I was always hiding from people, and I was always avoiding any kind of engagement with the world.  I kept telling myself, “maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow.”  But tomorrow never came.  Every day was the same bleak, depressing, uneventful day after the next.  I couldn’t break myself out of the cycle of not achieving.  Until one day…

I discovered a secret formula for controlling the minds of  other people.  It's an ancient technique passed from generation to generation among the world's most influencial and powerful people.  And once you learn it, you'll know why it's been so closely guarded.  

The secret is what I needed to get my life out of a rut and onto the road to TOTAL and ABSOLUTE SUCCESS.  Totally bankrupt on every level, I realized I was the only one responsible for the power I did or did not have.  For the first time, I saw everything so clearly.  How everything works and how to get everything you want.  From that day on my income has increased a thousand-fold, I’ve met hundreds of friends and whatever I choose to create I am able to do so effortlessly.""

<strong>The Intermedium of Tissue</strong>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">A variable represents a set of words in a particular order.  For example, x might equal the word-set {the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog}.  Note that the bracket represents the boundary of the word-set and is not included in the set itself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">A piece of writing, whether it be a book, magazine article, or a phone number can be thought of as a particular measurement of the world, both real and imaginary.  We can look at the piece of writing as a word-set containing punctuation, words, symbols and notation arranged in a particular order and within a particular boundary.  It can be used to take measurement and convey meaning.  The word-set of a novel might measure the fictional account of a love affair.    It uses thousands of nouns, verbs, prepositions, and other parts-of-speech in the correct order to calculate the result of the story.  The word-set of a phone number measures the code to connect two or more telephones in communication - including the metadata to designate area code and prefix.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">The observable elements of the word-set can be represented by modeling the hidden states of the elements.  For example, we could use a numerical index to represent the order of the elements.  We could also describe the hidden part-of-speech of each element based on a statistical model of the probable outcome of transition between parts-of-speech and the probable observable outcome of each state.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">Even if the set is transformed by randomly mixing its order, the measurement is still useful because it exposes the structure of the body of text.  This is easily discerned when paying attention to the grammatical structure.  If a set contained the nouns {hurt knee football} there is a good chance the word-set is measuring a football <em>injury</em>.  We could look to other elements in the set for additional clues.  In fact, by tagging each element in the word-set with a part-of-speech we can vary the complexity of the word-set by altering it at the purely grammatical structure.  It is way of writing and observing with attention focused on verbs, nouns, conjunctions, sentence-ending punctuation, question pronouns, possessive second determiners, etc.  The meaning or measurement of a rearranged word-set is not destroyed but rather a new measurement is taken from a different angle.  Part-of speech tagging (POST) is typically used in linguistic research and not generally considered a form of writing.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">To perform writing using POST, we can treat the word-set as a body of text and graft the elements of one set onto the grammatical structure of another to create a third body and word-set that is completely unique.  The elements could be assigned to the parts-of-speech either systematically or randomly.  A systematic approach leaves much less room for error because it takes into account word ambiguities.  A random approach has a higher margin of error because it rearranges without concern for valid syntactic orderings of words and does not recognize semantics.  But it can reveal more surprises by producing a greater quantity of combinations.  This differs from the proverbial infinite-number-of-typewriting-monkeys-eventually-recreating-Hamlet problem.  Cut-up writing is not necessarily a brute force attempt at creating the next masterpiece to be enjoyed by millions.  It’s an expressionistic record of selecting and arranging words utilizing a particular algorithm.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">Here is Tristan Tzara’s original algorithm.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>To make a dadaist poem take a newspaper.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Take a pair of scissors.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Cut out the article.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Shake it gently.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>The take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag. </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Copy conscientiously.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>The poem will be like you.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em> </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>And here you are a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar.</em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">In his famous 1916 stunt at Cabaret Voltaire, he shocked the audience by writing a poem with this method.  In effect, what he also wrote was an algorithm for producing a poem.  If we go along with him and assume his algorithm is correct, what he suggests is that if I conscientiously but randomly copy words from a pre-existing word-set to another structure, the new word set will be like me.  Therefore (if this law is commutative) I will be like the word-set.  My body will be indistinguishable from the body of text.    More accurately, we are bodies in a dance measuring time and place.  I should be able, using the correct equations, to rewrite myself and my life in an extremely literal sense.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">Many famous writers have attempted to do just this.  William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin each developed techniques for integrating cut-up writing into traditional writing in an often surrealist manner.  Their claim was that cut-up writing was so intertwined with reality that it was useful for mystical purposes.  They deduced that there must be a supernatural force at work choosing the words.   We can’t explain how the words are chosen for us, they just are.    Burroughs, Gysin, and others experimented with divination and precognition in their algorithms and claimed an expanded supernatural awareness by rearranging pre-existing word-sets.  Burroughs remarked that, ""Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">When taken extremely literally, the cut-up writing and resulting text alters the reader’s perception in a preternatural way. Proper nouns, for example, retain their meaning and importance but are re-imagined.  For example, a segment from a recombined word-set might read {John is a red cone.} It asks the reader to imagine John, perhaps someone we know, as a red cone.  What does that mean to say John IS a red cone?  If you start associating John and red cones, you might also begin to see actual examples in reality of red cones correlating with John.  It’s arguable whether this is magical or coincidental, but with enough practice it might become easy to tune our awareness to influences beyond our normal perception.  One possible technique would be to generate very large word-sets and mine them for bits of information that intuitively seem important.  If we deliberately pay attention to recombined words not intentionally written, we might find new ways of thinking about the world.  The recombined words need to be read as a personal message.  It is a leap of faith to assume cut-up writing creates word-sets that have been written  by some outside force specifically for the person reading it.   The fact remains that the words have, in fact, been created and do exist.  Both the content of the word-set and the act of reading it are brought into focus.  It places the body of the reader squarely within the text itself.   Randomness, when used to simulate the ordering of the set, is no longer sloppy or chaotic.  It’s difficult to find meaning in   purposelessly rolling dice, but meaning is created by rolling dice in the context of a game.  Randomly rearranging words is also difficult.  But within the context of an cut-up algorithm, meaning is also created.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">Critics of this approach claim the act of writing becomes too easy and doesn’t require the skill and patience of choosing and ordering words intentionally from the mind of the author.  We now live in an age of design, engineering, and information overload.  Anything that smacks of chaos is generally shunned.  With a multitude of word-sets competing for our attention, we tend to seek rich content over the ephemeral.  Well crafted information seems to travel between more people than information generated strictly by chance.  We simply do not have time to read and interpret cryptic messages.  Besides, it’s natural to want to read a word-set someone has taken the time to order very well.  It’s a pleasure to read a great novel or to read clear, concise instructions on how to do something.    The craft of ordering word-sets is a time-honored skill useful for conveying the meaning of our thoughts and evoking emotion within the reader. We tend to value the time it takes to choose just the right words and put them in just the right order. Reading a list of scrambled words is usually not pleasurable for the reader because it’s difficult and “meaningless.”  Perhaps this explains why cut-up writing is supernatural -- precisely because it is not natural.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">But recombinant or cut-up writing still serves a purpose.  Because it is relatively easy to create a unique word-set of thousands of elements in a short period of time, we are able to generate completely original sentences that might be otherwise go unnoticed.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">But the original artistic purpose remains.  There is a value in rearranging pre-existing word-sets even though the chaotic period of WWI and the overall mission of dada is over.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%"">The text tends to become much more expressionistic and non-representational.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 200%""></p>

Calling all time-travelers.

By creating this document to be institutionally archived as well as passed on as personal heirlooms we are sending you a message.  If time-travel is possible when you are reading this please visit us at the above time and location.

The three frames within the video represent the past, present, and future events surrounding the precise moment the traveler should appear.  All times used in the document were synced with the U.S. Naval Observatory atomic clock.

You will need a site to visit in the past which you will not disrupt.  We are expecting you and will not be hostile as others who are surprised might become.  The video will enter into personal and perhaps institutional archives to be later viewed by persons capable of traveling into the past to the moment in which we created the original video recording.

The key component of this process would be the archiving and preservation of the video in order to keep it “readable” by future people. It will be the duty of future archivists and librarians to convert the video into suitable and relevant formats.

The original video was captured on miniDV tape and later converted into Quicktime and Windows Media files.

If a time-traveler does not appear, one of the following might be true:

1.Time-travel will never become possible.
2.Time-travel becomes possible. Their time travel capabilities are inadequate to visit us.
3.Time-travel becomes possible. They do not wish to visit us.
4.Our archiving and preservation techniques are inadequate.  Our message does not reach the future.
5.Time travel becomes possible.  They are willing and able to travel to the past.  Our archiving and preservation techniques are adequate.  The message has not been accessed in its future database.
6. Time travel becomes possible.  They are willing and able to travel to the past.  Our archiving and preservation techniques are adequate.

Psychic Cheese is a quirky piece of online fiction that expresses the desire for personal transformation.  Blending self-help rhetoric with tongue-in-cheek metaphysics, the pseudo-corporate interface allows the user to “level up” their psychic abilities by interacting with a special device available for download.  The Psychic Cheese users manual mirrors popular directives for empowerment a la hypnosis and neuro-linguistic programming products.   Though Psychic Cheese is based on actual principles and might actually function as promised, its overarching purpose is as a critique of the inane world of online quackery.

Our plan was to float our ideas (whatever they might be) in the mass media with the hopes of picking up a little publicity.  It was going to be fun to use the corporate workflow and advertising structure to create a digital art project for school.  We started gaining just a grain of notoriety when another student in the department, John Fryer, exploded in the international media for  <a href=""http://www.allmylifeforsale.com"">All My Life For Sale</a>.  It was great to see one of us go all the way with a class project, but after John was interviewed by Conan O’Brian and his book was optioned by Warner Bros I started to get really pissed at him because I thought we were being graded on the curve.   I couldn't even get one of our local 'zines to cover me let alone appear on the Today Show.  Fortunately we all got an 'A' anyway.  Everybody wins.  </del>

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"">Consciousness </a> is a quality of the mind generally regarded to comprise qualities such as self-awareness, sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment. In common parlance, consciousness denotes being awake and responsive to one's environment; this contrasts with being asleep or being in a coma.

Consciousness is notoriously difficult to define or locate. Many cultures and religious traditions place the seat of consciousness in a soul separate from the body. Conversely, many scientists and philosophers consider consciousness to be intimately linked to the neural functioning of the brain.

An understanding of necessary preconditions for consciousness in the human brain may allow us to address important ethical questions. For instance, to what extent are non-human animals conscious? At what point in fetal development does consciousness begin? Can machines ever achieve conscious states? These issues are of great interest to those concerned with the ethical treatment of other beings, be they animals, fetuses, or in the future, machines.

The term 'pale-glo' refers to the barely perceptible emissions from our own thinking process.

Phase 1: dATAPLOT was an exhibit at the St. Xavier University Gallery that dealt with utilizing 'information' as a creative medium for self-expression. The show consisted of a video screening room, a conference room, and a traditional gallery space with 2-D work hung on the wall. The central focus of the exhibition was the computer generated textbook ALLOY and the collectible card game based on the book. dATAPLOT opened with a multimedia lecture/performance outlining the history of 'intermedia' art and 'information' art. One of the peculiar aspects of the lecture was the mind-bending stunt of transferring images from the mind of Matthew Butler directly to a sealed videotape without the use of equipment or technology. This was done live in front of an audience of 50+ people. In addition, visitors were able to take home as souvenirs the limited edition Diamond Junk Reports. DJR were a collection of informative articles with full reprinting rights included in their distribution specifically for dATAPLOT. This means that each visitor could go home and create a unique, custom product utilizing information from the exhibit. The show explored themes of ownership, copyright, and originality through the use of algorithmically created work and creative licensing. Chicagoartsdistrict.org called dATAPLOT, ""...ideas and data that transcend media and makes the viewer reconsider the digital age.""

Phase 2: colorBASIC.  By converting the gallery space at Mount Mercy College into a lounge we (myself, Kelli Spengler, Elaine Beck) hoped to complement the other lounges in the building by creating an aesthetic experience rather than purely functional one. Visitors could try on clothes, watch videos, look at paintings, take off their shoes and sit on fur rugs, relax and take a break without pressure to be entirely involved.

This project was the final culmination of a 13 year exloration of the world of get-rich-quick schemes.  In high school I sent away for John Wright's ""The Royal Road To Riches,"" a home-publishing business that suggested the easiest way to become a millionare was to reprint books about reprinting books and sell them in the classified ads.  This was 1989.   In college, I bought into <a href=""http://www.stefanchik.com"">John Stefanchik's</a> ""Profits Through Paper,"" a method for generating wealth by purchasing liens on property and reselling them for a huge profit.   This was 1995.  In graduate school I became fascinated with the actual <em>idea</em> of get-rich-quick schemes instead of one in particular.  I learned to love them because they create a fictional world that is more entertaining, in my opinon, than any book, movie, or game.  You should try one.  Instead of feeling smug because you've <a href=""http://mbutler.org/projects/index.php?p=24"">avoided a con </a>like the rest of responsible, frugal America, think of the hours of enjoyment you get out of your $19.95. Or $99.95.  It's a blast to pretend for a few weeks that you're the CEO of your very own corporation.  You should be embracing your junk email, not avoiding it.  Someday you just might be able to actually fire your boss.

Elfprize is my stab at online retail utilizing the <a href=""http://www.smcorp.com"">SMC</a> ""engine"".  So far I've generated exactly zero dollars in profit, but it's been a hoot.  It started out as a Flash game that would simulate elves mailing prizes to its winners.  Higher scores would receive better prizes.  After quite a bit of legal research, I discovered that my funding model violated several state racing and gaming laws.  Instead, as sort of a consolation prize, I created the site as it is archived now.  Unfortunately I was never able to send out actual merchandise.

For a short time, months after the initial launch, Elfprize.com offered the snow removal services of its mascot elf character.  With each sidewalk and driveway cleared, customers could also elect to hear the sad story of one Christmas elf named Marty.  The story went that Marty was a helper of Santa who fell asleep in someone's house on Christmas Eve.  Left behind with no flying reindeer, the poor elf had to work his way back to the North Pole by doing odd jobs.  By the end of the story Marty's eyes are opened to a world of post-holiday depression and consumer guilt.  He spends time aimlessly walking the department store aisles of 75% off X-mas merchandise in utter disbelief over humanity's capacity to forget about Christmas for several months out of the year.  For the first time Marty's world is not one of perpetual Christmas cheer.  Instead, he learns to deal with his existential funk by gleefully performing the drudgery involved in after-holiday cleanup.

<strong>chain gang theory:</strong>
The Markov Chain Gang are t.v. characters trapped behind the show’s wall of fiction, fighting to escape through ruptures in the script’s disjointed writing. Language is being eaten by the myriad stochastic computer processes constantly at work in our culture-system.  Television viewers have matured or evolved into cybernetic image consumers capable of digesting smaller and smaller bits of video until content becomes irrelevant.  Television sets are no longer windows to another world, but feedback mechanisms integrated into our identity and physiology.  The Markov Chain Gang craves the luxury of the observer/viewer context.  They ask: “How is it that you know this is a soap opera?  Are you a detective, looking for trace structures outside my motivation?  Are you a prisoner like me?”

Flipping through different channels and different shows is an artistic act.  It’s actually all one channel, all one show.  The Gang is subverting composition by applying painterly collage techniques to pre-existing script language.  Older notions such as act structure, continuity and temporality fall to stranger development.  Horizontal, non-hierarchical themes emerge.  There are no tidy conclusions that let you know how everything turns out.  The show is a constant state of becoming a new show.  Each Markov Chain Gang episode is just a bracketed data set inside a theoretically infinite order.  It references and resembles, but the conceptual process’ transformative nature amounts to legal plagiarism; borrowing and reconstituting without stealing.  The Markov Chain Gang is a television show not about its content, story or characters, but rather the antithetical story of the decisions of repression and change in the script as it meets the demands of the genre.

<strong>how to write it:</strong>
The episodes are written by choosing television scripts from different TV shows.  This source material should be chosen according to what flavor or mood the writer wants the resulting Markov Chain Gang script to have.  Once a few thousand words have been copied from the source material, they are analyzed by one of many computer programs that run Markov Chain algorithms.  There are many different algorithms that cut-up text, but Markov’s seems to be the favorite with poets and artists.  

The output text will be sentences that have been broken apart and put back together with other sentences and words.  It’s difficult to read at this point, so a writer needs to work the cut-up material into a useable script.  One can think of a genre as a template.  The writer needs locations, characters, situations.  Something to differentiate, say, a television script from a novel.  When the writer has in mind what that is, they dip into the Markoved source text for answers.  There are locations, characters, situations there… they just need to be extracted.  The writer should not attempt to control the script, but rather let the script happen on its own.  Expect clash, chaos and surprise.  With practice, the writer is able to act merely as a catalyst for the scripts creation rather than its author.  There is something out there giving us life.

<strong>epilogue:</strong>
I invented a game.  It’s called Quantum Twenty Questions.  It’s just like 20 Questions, except no-one has an object in mind when the game starts.

First, you ask a question like, “Is it an animal?”  Then you flip a coin and if it’s heads the answer is yes.  If it’s tails, no.

You proceed this way until you find out exactly what the object is.  Where did this object come from?  Obviously from your own mind, right?  Is it a television?  Heads.  Yes.",,0,the-markov-chain-gang,post,open,closed,0,mbutler,"projects:projects,projects~fiction:fiction,projects~language:language",,,,,,,,

There has been quite a bit of work done up to this point on computer generated writing.  From the sophisticated and serious attempts at natural language generation to the silly online cut-up scripts for creating nonsense poetry.  Sure, there have been real improvements in the field of informatics, but what advances have the poets and artists made?  In the early part of the 20th century, Tristan Tzara created the first Dada poem by cutting up a newspaper then drawing the random scraps from a hat.  This act was supremely radical in its ascription of meaning onto chance operations but it seems ""chance"" in art has been played out for some time now.  Computation has extended the life of this artistic endevour by a few years, but again, we are at the end of the road of chance operation in art and poetry.  It simply does not produce aesthetically pleasing output - even for those familiar with its historical traditions.  So what can be done?

<strong>Summary </strong>
""MICA-TV's Cascade (vertical landscapes) is an example of a very different kind of video work, with constantly panning and shifting camera work creating a dialogue between architecture and landscape. Michael Smith's humorous piece uses the camera work and production values of commercial television to very different ends. Paul Garrin's video both documents an incident of police brutality in New York and further explores political activism and protest through the use of video""--Insert. 
In Conversations Vito Acconci, with Steven Poser, delivers an interesting talk, almost a performance, about his work.

A) Receiving predictive information concerning one’s environment has been the greedy desire of humankind since the construction of language as a tool thousands of years ago.  If only we could describe what is just over the horizon!  What an edge we’d have over our “competition” if we already had the specialized language to discuss the newness of tomorrow today.
 
B) As we continuously enter the new newness of so-called 'new media' and 'new age', our natural language is intermingling with programming language in shocking and considerable ways. Meaning is constructed out of clearly defined protocols that either “work” or “do not work”  -- there is no third position here.  For the first time in existence, <a href=""http://mbutler.org/projects/index.php?p=14"">Poem and Code</a> are the same.  Though this ‘new language’ is less susceptible to the confusing ambiguities of old (i.e. we cannot use variables and handlers without clearly declaring their value and defining their procedure) there is still a magic in language which contributes to human evolution. 

C) Language in some way creates the very reality in which we live. Words and concepts point to realities beyond the sensory world and assist us in making contact with a dimension that is higher, lower and parallel.

D) The great DADA experiment of cut-up writing carried out by Tzara, Burroughs, Gysin and others has now reached epic proportions.  The intent was to jitter thought process with randomness in language.  That jitter is now quake-like in magnitude thanks to advances in programmable electronics and automatic algorithms.  What took them hours with newspapers and scissors now takes us seconds with computers -- I can do 4 million words over brunch.  We are no longer creating experimental voices but communicating with beings from other worlds.

E) Intangible Ideas, in Plato's conception — as supersensible realities beyond human thought — are captured in scripts, as prisoners in their cells, and released by the act of perusal, setting the prisoners free. These Ideas reside in the words and terms independent of the programs and books in which the words are encased. Yet how and where, in the interval between their setting down and their taking up, do they abide? By what secret tract is their existence in the mind of the author/programmer connected with their resuscitation in the mind of the reader/user? Why at the sight of certain lines and figures on the voiceless page/screen do these particular thoughts spring up into renewed activity? What is the indiscoverable nexus between the physical vibrations of light and these immaterial substances of our noetic life? 

F) Homo Sapiens unlocked the mystery power of their brains through the invention of language thousands of years ago.  Language allowed them to reflect in a self-aware manner, invent finely crafted tools, and create handmade ornaments, shelter, and paintings. This epoch process is culminating in programmable electronics.  We are becoming aware, again since before language, that the fracture between “subject” and “object” is unreal.  What is more necessary... the operating language of a word processor or the inputted creative language of its user?

This is a working control panel developed for an experimental Alternate Reality Game (ARG).  The purpose is to help the player make their way through the difficulties of life and eventually reach self-actualization.  It is also a convenient method for ordering service from that person.  Though the players are real humans, they might be assumed to be androids or virtual assistants.  When a player logs in, they are able to input directives or suggestions for other players on how they should respond to their environment based on current conditions.  The directives are sent to a mobile device that can be used to either accept or deny.  The player is able to see what suggestions are currently being used.  Also, at any time, players can use their mobile device to update various status bars that monitor their life.  The status categories are borrowed from the video game Tropico.

This video explores the spiraling loop of infinite regress involved in this mental process by merging the video representation of the words ""thinking"" and ""talking"" into one complex state.

It was created by recording myself saying the word ""thinking"" and ""talking.""  I then mashed them together using the the ""timeline scrubbing"" technique, simulaing the thinking/talking metal process and thus controlling myself as a 'video puppet'.  It's very efficient in that it recycles 60 frames of video to create a 7 minute piece.

The soundscape is a digital collage which is constructed of layers of archival machine sounds and workers' voices, submerging and emerging from the noise.  The performers have developed a palette of choreographed movements that are either synchronized (based upon actual workers' repetitive task motions) or improvisational (the opposite of regimented work).  Machines are omnipresent in this performance as desired objects, as sounds, as systems both repressive and expressive.

Words are deployed in three ways: 1) A voice-over narrative is a composite of many women's stories of the workplace; 2) Projected inscriptions reclaim the site with taxonomies of job names, car names. etc; 3 ) Archival voices are subsumed into the digital soundscape—they are ghosts in the machine.

The videos projected on the site are either archival film footage of workers (like X-rays into the past of the buildings) or re-creations of actions remembered by former workers.  Although we focused upon the work experiences of women, we also included men in outreach.

Sarsenworld is a theoretical video game that explores the concept of ""death"" in a blurred distinction between fact and fiction.  It's a game-world where players can sacrifice their life and be reborn inside the game.  The strange, paranormal interface allows players to control their characters ""on the other side,"" and communicate or seek guidance with the ghosts of former players.  Once players die, however, they are cut from their human body and exist as a self-aware character as part of the virtual environment.  To create Sarsenworld, every last nuance of human behavior must be categorized and codified.  This gives players the added feature of being able to twist nature to serve their own occult indulgences.  We are under the control of an advanced AI who is omnipresent and all seeing; everyone knows that!   Learn to perform queries on this cosmic database and you just might ""level up.""  Sarsenworld requires players to perform cryptic rituals with the screen characters in order to unlock the layers of reality that would allow them to communicate with the beyond.  The game also utilizes advanced motion detection and speech recognition technology to translate the verbal commands and hand gestures required to summon the game ""spirits"" to do your bidding.  It takes advantage of PML (Psionic Markup Language) to allow greater functionality with the afterlife.  The ""spirits"" are a proprietary mixture of real ghosts and state-of-the-art algorithms used to simulate personalities and resurrect dead people 'IRL'.  The ability to actually die and be reborn inside the game has been disabled for the demo. 

First appeared at the Tender, Squalacious, and Digital show at the University of Iowa Museum of Art.

13,"2002-04-11 14:07:30",publish,"Floating Video","It's been a long standing desire of ours to tie a video camera to helium balloons then fly it around town.  This experiment set out to do just that.  What we found out is that you must have one giant helium balloon.  No amount of regular sized balloons will float a small electronic device because the latex of the balloons is too heavy.  It did make the camera very light, so we were able to throw it up into the air and watch it float to the ground.  We used three cameras.  One on the balloons and two more to document the process of trying to make it fly.  Eventually we cut the camera free and watched as our balloons floated away.  The end result was a 3-channel video installation at the International Center, Iowa City.  The three DV decks were synced to play footage from the two cameras just as the balloon-camera footage abrubtly ended.

14,"2001-06-11 15:37:09",publish,"Haptic Author: The {haphazardly/carefully} {written/read} line of {poem/code}","Haptic Author was a research project dealing with the writing and modifying of multi-dimensional English sentences and sentence fragments purely through touch.   The goal was to discover new ways of presenting and accessing electronic information other than ""link clicking"" through static content.  Often times these experiments blurred the line between subject and object and could shift the narrative voice depending on the user's input.   The project consisted of dynamic sentences with four or more potential versions ""hidden"" behind each other that could be accessed via custom software designed for a Panasonic touch screen.  For this version only binary changes were made at the word level, though multiple changes could be possible.  Shown here is the 'I want/won't (to) be(lie)ve' sentence as part of an installation at the Parquet Gallery in Iowa City.

A few of the sentences/fragments used for this gallery version:

{I/You} {want/won't} (to) be(lie)ve.
{I/You} {watching/touching} {me/you.}
The {haphazardly/carefully} {written/read} line of {poem/code}
{I/You} have {no/a} choice{./?}
{I/You} {know/don't know} what I/you mean{./?}
{n/m}otions of {pro/re}gress
{I am/You are} {not} {important}

This is a conceptual translation of the sentence “Sometimes I think like a computer.”  into binary, where each letter is represented by a string of 8 ones or zeros.  1=YES 0=NO.  Some people believe that the entire universe is the result of a series of yes-or-no choices that take place at the quantum level.  Others believe the entire universe is contained within the human mind.  Some feel that our mind is just a computing device.  I haven't made up mine yet.  Maybe.

We took over the Monday night 10pm slot on Iowa City Free Radio from DJ Trainwreck and Rook Brut (both now in Chicago).  That was spring 2001.   In 2003 we came up with the name Preachcricket by rolling it randomly with the band name generator appendix in the paper-and-pencil RPG ""So You Want to Be a Rock and Roll Star.''  'Sparklebook' was a close second. Mix tapes being uploaded now.
