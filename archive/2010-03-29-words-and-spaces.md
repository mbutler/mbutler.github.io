I need to confess a sin.  At some point between 1997-1999 I stole a book from the [Russell D. Cole Library][1] entitled [Words and Spaces: An Anthology of Twentieth Century Musical Experiments in Language and Sonic Environments ][2]by Stuart Saunders Smith and Thomas DeLio (editors and contributors).

It was processed as a new item into their collection on January 10, 1991.  It was not checked out a single time before I stole it.  The book was in pristine condition and obviously prepared for long-term archival storage.  It was a library edition hardback and the call number was carefully taped to the upper-left corner of the cover.  On the inside cover and flyleaf were the tags of two old cataloging systems: the card catalog and digital barcode.  The inside cover had a crisp manilla-colored  pocket containing two identical cards except for their color, one white the other yellow.  All three items (the two cards and the envelope) each had the call number printed.  780.904 W891.  The cards also had the title of the book printed as &#8220;Words and spaces&#8221;.  The flyleaf had the &#8220;DATE DUE&#8221; sticker, waiting for up to 68 new stamps pointing to the future due dates.  In the upper-right corner of the flyleaf was a barcode sticker, a relic of the new digital catalog. The barcode contained significantly more information.  The name of the library, the call number, the title of &#8220;Words and spaces&#8221;, this time including a colon, indicating there may be a subtitle, MAIN (I assume this is a default field meant for universities or municipalities with branch libraries), the barcode and the barcode number.  I wish I remember what metadata the item record contained looked like.

Not a single person checked this book out in the previous six years before I took it.  When I found it on the shelf (after who-knows-what keyword search in the catalog), I knew the book belonged in my collection.

1.  No one wanted it but me
2.  It was highly relevant to my research interests at the time
3.  The collection needed weeding anyway
4.  No one wanted it but me

A synopsis:

> This volume is presented as a collection of primary research materials for scholars and artists. Each composer presents either a score or some form of documentation of one of his works and, in an accompanying essay, discusses his music in detail, exploring both its aesthetic and structural premises. The purpose of this book is not to present analyses or critical evaluations of this original and diverse body of works but rather, for the first time, to document the major activities of recent composers working in the important hybrid media of sound-text and sound-installation. It is hoped that this book will mark the beginning of a general recognition of the importance of such inter-media works as well as encourage future exploration of the aesthetic and structural innovations continued therein. Composers discussed include John Cage, Robert Ashley, Max Neuhaus, Alvin Lucier and Kenneth Gaburo.

The tragedy of this crime is that I barely cracked the book once, I&#8217;m sure for many of the same reasons why it was never checked out.  I felt like once I &#8220;owned&#8221; the book I absorbed whatever power it held.  Without reading it I somehow consumed the knowledge and secrets held within.  It was full of strange drawings, runes, circuit diagrams, music scores, and typographical experiments.  It was arcane and wondeful.  I didn&#8217;t know about any of the artists who&#8217;s work was reprinted in Words and Spaces, but very soon after stealing this book I entered an MFA program in Intermedia art.  The names which ones seemed obscure are now immediately recognizable.  Robert Ashley, John Cage, Max Neuhaus, Kenneth Gaburo, Alvin Curran.  Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think a single woman was represented in it.

My new year&#8217;s resolution is to read this book at last, learn from it, then return it to the library.
