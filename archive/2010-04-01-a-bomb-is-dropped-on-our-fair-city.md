Apparently Thursday night at the Yacht Club was the first exposure many Iowa Citians had with dubstep, a UK dance musical form from the past decade.  I wouldn&#8217;t call myself an enormous fan, but I&#8217;ve listened to quite a bit of it.  I hate to get all hipstery, but it just surprises me that so many people were blown away by a beat that&#8217;s been around for a while.  I was expecting less ravey dance and more hip-hop, but such is life.

I had another successful night running the Old Stage Stop Photography Co., which is really just me sitting at the historical marker on the corner of Washington and Linn streets between Mission Creek shows waiting for interesting things to happen.  Last night Les Dames du Burlesque stopped by and I managed to not fuck it up and get some ok photos.

> The marker at the northwest corner of Washington and Linn Streets indicates the location of the Iowa City stage coach stop along old Military Road from Dubuque to the northern boundary of Missouri. The stop was authorized by Congress in 1839. Legend has it that Samuel Clemens’ opinion of Iowa City was diminished by a spill he took while dismounting a stage coach here in the late 1800’s.
