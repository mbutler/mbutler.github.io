I&#8217;ve worked off and on in the wide world of &#8220;Library Audiovisual Services&#8221; since 1993.  Back in the good old days it was mostly about running around delivering slide and overhead projectors to various rooms.  It&#8217;s a fairly thankless job since the whole point it to remain invisible unless something goes wrong, in which case hell shall be released upon the Earth.  Not that I need a round of applause every time I change a bulb, but it&#8217;s tech support and unless you&#8217;ve worked tech support you just don&#8217;t and won&#8217;t understand.   ANYWAY.  I stumbled upon a letter I had to write to the Library Director back in November 1998 defending myself from the Assistant Director of Student Services attack on me.  This particular person, who shall remain nameless, was a particular Type-A personality that I sometimes (often) have trouble working with (as do many of my tech and IT brethren).

This type of person is usually characterized in the following ways:

1.  Has a fiery, go-get-em attitude
2.  Needs everything immediately, lest there be a crisis
3.  Often treats colleagues as underlings
4.  Is on their way to something bigger and better
5.  Overdresses for their job
6.  Feels they, and they alone, are the only ones capable of setting agendas &#8211; AND SET AGENDAS THEY MUST!

The reason I point this out is because at first glance this type of worker seems amazing.  So much energy!  So much enthusiasm for meetings!  So much busy work!  But they usually lack any ability to see outside their world and realize it takes all types of people to make an organization work.  Everything must be done their way, damn it, and they can&#8217;t understand why everyone isn&#8217;t like them.

They end up being the enemy of tech support because they feel IT or AV should cater directly to their personal needs on an emergency-level basis, despite the fact IT or AV must attend to *everyone*.  The letter was a lengthy point-by-point rebuttal to her complaints, but the part of this letter from her that made me laugh was the following gem:

> *Lack of support when problems occur with AV equipment after the office closes or when no one is in the office during the day.*

In other words, complaining that I&#8217;m not in my office every hour of the day and night.  I offered to hire 7 more people but that was quickly turned down by my boss.  I also offered to be on-call for her, but in return I&#8217;d need her to come onto campus with me to verify my work whenever I was called in an emergency.  That was also quickly turned down.

Let me restate and emphasize my point:  **It takes all types of workers to run a successful organization.** We need fast workers, kind workers, smart workers, methodical workers, workers who are good with people, workers who are good with technology, organized workers and creative workers.  It&#8217;s unrealistic to expect each of us to be everything to everyone.  This should be obvious, but often isn&#8217;t.
