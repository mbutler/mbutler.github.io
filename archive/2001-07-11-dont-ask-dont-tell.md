Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell: The Role of Health Professionals In Dealing with Substance Abuse was produced simultaneously with [The Ethics of Genetic Testing][3]. The CD-ROM included hours of video interviews, stories, and case studies into an interactive learning environment to inform health professionals about the impacts of substance abuse in rural areas. Included on the disc were several multimedia learning objectives for the user to gain an understanding of the biology of addiction including basic neuroscience, pharmacology and behavioral science at a level easily understood by the general public.
