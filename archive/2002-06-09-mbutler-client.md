![mButler client][1]  
This is a working control panel developed for an experimental Alternate Reality Game (ARG). The purpose is to help the player make their way through the difficulties of life and eventually reach self-actualization. It is also a convenient method for ordering service from that person. Though the players are real humans, they might be assumed to be androids or virtual assistants. When a player logs in, they are able to input directives or suggestions for other players on how they should respond to their environment based on current conditions. The directives are sent to a mobile device that can be used to either accept or deny. The player is able to see what suggestions are currently being used. Also, at any time, players can use their mobile device to update various status bars that monitor their life. The status categories are borrowed from the video game Tropico.
