![Treatment for Damaged Audio and Video][1]

Scavenged snippets of damaged library A/V material reconstituted into an impressionistic video narrative about ‘helping.’ Displayed as single channel video as well as multiple monitor installation. Winner of the Juror&#8217;s Choice Award at the 2001 Film and Video Retrospective, Des Moines Art Center.
