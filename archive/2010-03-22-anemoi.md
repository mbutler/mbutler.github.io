Waking up this Monday morning was something beautiful.  The sun was shining, historic health care reform is now law, and AT&T brings the 3G network to Iowa City iPhone customers!  Just in time for my new iPhone app thingy, Anemoi.

In Greek mythology, the Anemoi were wind gods who were each ascribed a cardinal direction, from which their respective winds came, and were each associated with various seasons and weather conditions. They were often personified as winged men and, according to the Greek poet Hesiod, were the children of Astraeus and the goddess of the dawn Eos.

Modern civilization doesn&#8217;t have much time for poetic interpretations of natural phenomena. We are a people of science and numbers. We look for quantifiable measurements and then we are on our way. This web application attempts to bridge the gap between data and poetry. It queries NOAA for current wind directions based on an airport of your choosing then returns the results as the appropriate wind god of Greek mythology. See how useful this would be if you lived in ancient Greece?? YEAH

HOW TO INSTALL

Point your iPhone/iPod Touch browser at this URL:

<a onmousedown="UntrustedLink.bootstrap($(this),  &quot;53631896a9799943dd6f0ac94db7041e&quot;, event)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iws.mx/anemoi" target="_blank">http://www.iws.mx/anemoi</a>

Then choose an airport &#8211; either the closest one to you or one you&#8217;re curious about (there are a lot to scroll through but it will return to the one you have chosen).

Once your data/gods have loaded, press + and choose &#8220;Add to Home Screen&#8221;

Now when you launch the Anemoi app it will load your chosen airport. Feel free to change your location whenever you want. I might be adding Location Services support, we&#8217;ll see.

Enjoy the wind!
