There&#8217;s [an article in this month&#8217;s Little Village Magazine][1] in which three friends and LV contributors talk about their love affair with Iowa City.  I envy these guys because they all seem like down-to-earth dudes who know how to manage their relationship with Iowa City in a sane, adult way.  They don&#8217;t ask too much and are always willing to give back to the relationship.  It&#8217;s easy to see that when they get Iowa City pregnant they&#8217;re always there for moral support, to rub tired feet, give awesome back rubs, and go to all the lamaze classes.  They are the type of kind, patient boyfriend or husband any town would want.  Their babies grow up to be those well-behaved attractive kids that everyone loves.

My artistic relationship with Iowa City is more like a typical marriage going on 15 years.  Sure, we love each other but the spark just isn&#8217;t there anymore.  We don&#8217;t fight but we aren&#8217;t exactly consumed by passion either.  Our children are C students who got busted drinking behind the high school last April.  There&#8217;s a thought that maybe we&#8217;re just staying together for the kids and life might be more exciting if we cheat.  Chicago was totally hitting on me last weekend and it made me feel sexy for the first time in years.

How did we get here, Iowa City?  Our love affair was so steamy when we were working on that MFA together.  Can we ever get that back?

I blame myself.  I haven&#8217;t put in the work that you deserve.  I&#8217;m there to help out if you ask a couple of times but I don&#8217;t initiate enough of the housework.   You wanted me to help organize some amazing artists&#8217; warehouse space a few months ago and instead I sat around playing Fallout 3.  Not cool, and I&#8217;m sorry.

To be fair though, you never want to do anything new it seems.  Whenever I suggest a new project you just fall back to the same stuff we&#8217;ve been doing since the 90&#8217;s.  I know where to go to find singers, poets, crafters, and gardeners but I can never seem to find hackers, video artists, media designers, and developers.  Am I too digital for you?

I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll get through this like we always do.  Baths is playing at Gabe&#8217;s in a couple of weeks.  There&#8217;s 3-D porn at the Bijou tonight.  And hey, Jimmy Wales is coming to town, so that&#8217;s cool.  We can make it work if we stick together.  If you promise not to roll your eyes when I start talking about computers I promise not to nod off when you start playing folk music.
