Haptic Author: The {haphazardly/carefully} {written/read} line of {poem/code} was a research project dealing with the writing and modifying of multi-dimensional English sentences and sentence fragments purely through touch. The goal was to discover new ways of presenting and accessing electronic information other than &#8220;link clicking&#8221; through static content. Often times these experiments blurred the line between subject and object and could shift the narrative voice depending on the user&#8217;s input. The project consisted of dynamic sentences with four or more potential versions &#8220;hidden&#8221; behind each other that could be accessed via custom software designed for a Panasonic touch screen. For this version only binary changes were made at the word level, though multiple changes could be possible. Shown here is the &#8216;I want/won&#8217;t (to) be(lie)ve&#8217; sentence as part of an installation at the Parquet Gallery in Iowa City.

A few of the sentences/fragments used for this gallery version:

{I/You} {want/won&#8217;t} (to) be(lie)ve.  
{I/You} {watching/touching} {me/you.}  
The {haphazardly/carefully} {written/read} line of {poem/code}  
{I/You} have {no/a} choice{./?}  
{I/You} {know/don&#8217;t know} what I/you mean{./?}  
{n/m}otions of {pro/re}gress  
{I am/You are} {not} {important}

![I want/won't (to) be(lie)ve][1]
