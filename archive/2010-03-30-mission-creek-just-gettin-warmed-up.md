This week will be completely dominated by Mission Creek and some mad documentation.  I&#8217;m taking pictures and capturing audio for Little Village Magazine.  [The Flickr stream][1] is up, and mp3s are on their way!.  Stay tuned, but here&#8217;s a preview of one of tonight&#8217;s acts.  One of my favorites, Birds & Batteries!

    The perfect blend of synth and other good bits.
