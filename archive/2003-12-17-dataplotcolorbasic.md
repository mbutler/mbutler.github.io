![dATAPLOT card][1]  
Phase 1: dATAPLOT was an exhibit at the St. Xavier University Gallery that dealt with utilizing &#8216;information&#8217; as a creative medium for self-expression. The show consisted of a video screening room, a conference room, and a traditional gallery space with 2-D work hung on the wall. The central focus of the exhibition was the computer generated textbook ALLOY and the collectible card game based on the book. dATAPLOT opened with a multimedia lecture/performance outlining the history of &#8216;intermedia&#8217; art and &#8216;information&#8217; art. One of the peculiar aspects of the lecture was the mind-bending stunt of transferring images from the mind of Matthew Butler directly to a sealed videotape without the use of equipment or technology. This was done live in front of an audience of 50+ people. In addition, visitors were able to take home as souvenirs the limited edition Diamond Junk Reports. DJR were a collection of informative articles with full reprinting rights included in their distribution specifically for dATAPLOT. This means that each visitor could go home and create a unique, custom product utilizing information from the exhibit. The show explored themes of ownership, copyright, and originality through the use of algorithmically created work and creative licensing. Chicagoartsdistrict.org called dATAPLOT, &#8220;&#8230;ideas and data that transcend media and makes the viewer reconsider the digital age.&#8221;

Phase 2: colorBASIC. By converting the gallery space at Mount Mercy College into a lounge we (myself, Kelli Spengler, Elaine Beck) hoped to complement the other lounges in the building by creating an aesthetic experience rather than purely functional one. Visitors could try on clothes, watch videos, look at paintings, take off their shoes and sit on fur rugs, relax and take a break without pressure to be entirely involved.
