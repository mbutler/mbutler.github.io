<p><img src="http://www.mbutler.org/images/thinktalk.jpg" alt="thinking" /><img When thinking about talking or talking about thinking, it's often difficult to do either. This video explores the spiraling loop of infinite regress involved in this mental process by merging the video representation of the words "thinking" and "talking" into one complex state.</p>
<p>It was created by recording myself saying the word "thinking" and "talking."  I then mashed them together using the the "timeline scrubbing" technique, simulaing the thinking/talking metal process and thus controlling myself as a 'video puppet'.  It's very efficient in that it recycles 60 frames of video to create a 7 minute piece.  </p>
