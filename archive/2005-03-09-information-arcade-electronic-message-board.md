This electronic display was developed as a way for the staff to easily publish monthly news and content in a public environment. The message board pulls public domain videos from archive.org, displays which of the staff are currently at the help desk, what equipment is checked out or not, and it also has a tickertape text with current news. Content is trasported via XML and can be dynamically changed via a web form.
