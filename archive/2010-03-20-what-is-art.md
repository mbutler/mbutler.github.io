Awwww yeah.  A new season in a new year in a new decade in a new century in a new millenium.  A new blog!

Instead of a typical &#8220;Oh hai welcome to my nu blag&#8221; post,

I&#8217;m going to answer one of the most difficult questions in all of modern culture.  Not because this web log is about art,  it&#8217;s not necessarily.  Rather, as someone who&#8217;s spent probably too much time studying art, I&#8217;m gonna use it right here to solve a difficult problem within my field.  That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m going to settle this age-old question of &#8220;What is Art&#8221; right here, once and for all.  This question comes up **a lot** online.  It usually revolves around complaining that something seen in a gallery actually isn&#8217;t &#8220;Art&#8221; or that some form of popular entertainment actually is &#8220;Art&#8221;.  So let&#8217;s talk about this.

disclaimer:  I really don&#8217;t care so much about the &#8220;art&#8221; designation in day-to-day life.  If you are a creative type just keep doing your thing and don&#8217;t worry about what is and isn&#8217;t art.  This is more just a thought experiment.

You may, at some point, find yourself in a discussion with a friend or colleague about Art and its ontological properties.  By &#8220;Art with a Capital A &#8221; we&#8217;re usually talking about the stuff found in galleries, museums, and universities.  The kind of Art with a stamp of approval from professional curators and historians.  The kind of art some people like to stratify into the &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;low&#8221; variety.  Perhaps the discussion lands on a performance you heard about once where an artist sat in the middle of the gallery and screamed the names of former lovers while wrapped in cellophane.  Perhaps not, but we&#8217;ll use that as an example.  Let&#8217;s title it *You See Right Through Me.*

Let&#8217;s pretend you or your friend (or both of you) insist that *You See Right Through Me* simply *can not *be Art.  There may be a variety of reasons why you feel this way. Some of the reasons may include:

*   Anyone could do this and it takes no skill
*   It is not a painting
*   No one can understand it without a description or artist&#8217;s statement
*   It&#8217;s weird
*   She&#8217;s just doing it to get attention
*   Only pretentious people think it&#8217;s art

In your mind these might be perfectly good reasons to invalidate the art.  There is a flaw in this reasoning, however.  It is the same logical flaw I would be making were I to say an accountant is not doing Arithmetic when they figure your taxes.  After all, I can do my own taxes, it takes copious written descriptions to understand,  and OMG why should you be *certified* to do taxes, that&#8217;s just pretentious! (kidding).   But a CPA just seems to be better at accounting than I.  I can certainly add, subtract, multiply, and divide but I don&#8217;t have the same inside information to navigate that world in the best way possible.   Making something look easy doesn&#8217;t mean it didn&#8217;t take years of practice to get there.  This is kind of what it&#8217;s like for artists, event the ones making crazy postmodern conceptual art.  Let&#8217;s face it:  there are shitty artists and shitty accountants, but it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not working within their chosen field.

Ok, so the keyword here is *context. *When an activity is done within an art context it&#8217;s art.  *It really is that simple*.  So what creates the magical art context?  First, let me digress.

Think of the word &#8216;milk&#8217;.  Is that word a noun or a verb?  Hmmm.  Depends on the *context*, doesn&#8217;t it?  If you say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to milk the cow&#8221; it&#8217;s a verb.  Say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to drink the milk&#8221; and presto-change-o the word magically becomes a noun!  It all happens via the power of context.

If, one day, you get a wild hair up your ass and decide to run a bunch of pipes throughout a room you need to ask yourself why.  Why am I doing this?  If you&#8217;re doing it in your house in order to flush a toilet then you&#8217;re probably doing* plumbing*.  If you&#8217;re doing it in a gallery for the aesthetic benefit of visitors you&#8217;re probably doing *art. *Usually (but not always) you must be using materials and media in a slightly new and interesting way in order to land that gallery show.  This is why it&#8217;s going to be hard to get those model airplanes you&#8217;ve been building in your basement into the Guggenheim.  They might be art to you but they&#8217;ve been done so many times that a large art institution isn&#8217;t going to pay attention.  This would not stop you from fixing your basement up into an art gallery and having a model airplane exhibit.  By transforming that space you&#8217;ve created an art context and &#8212; guess what?  IT&#8217;S ART!  This is why so many artists are attracted to painting; it&#8217;s got all the art context you need built right in with no need to justify the activity as Art.

Instead of talking directly about the insanely abstract concept of Art, we need to instead get more specific.

In computer science there&#8217;s a paradigm called object-oriented programming.  I bring this up because artists work with objects and it might be a useful metaphor.  Without getting too technical, here&#8217;s a brief lesson in OOP.

A *class *is an abstract template to create specific *objects. *For example, there could be a class called Car* *which describes something with four tires, an engine that runs on gasoline, has a steering wheel, etc.  That Car class has several properties and variables that can change to make different *objects *that are similar yet different.  An *object *is a specific instance of a *class. *An example object made with the Car class might be the 1999 Ford Escort sitting out in your driveway.  That 1999 Ford Escort is similar in many ways to a 2000 Toyota Tercel because they are both instances of the Car class, yet they are different in many ways.  Instead of having to create a separate 1999 Ford Escort Car *class* and a 2000 Toyota Tercel Car *class, *we can make one generic and abstract Car class that we use for all cars.  When we make the Toyota class and the Ford class, which will differentiate those car objects,  we can *inherit *the properties from the generic Car class because all cars have a certain amount of properties that are the same.  It just makes things easier to not have to specify common properties over and over again .

[<img class="aligncenter" title="Car Class" src="http://www.mattbutler.net/images/car-class.png" alt="car class" width="400" height="400" />][1]

So for this very simple example, all Toyotas and all Fords would *inherit *the property of having four tires, etc.  All Toyotas would *inherit* the property of getting over 40 mpg.  Fords *inherit *roll cages. You get the idea.  A real and complete diagram of the Car class inheritance would be thousands of classes.  We&#8217;d have a class for tires, for radios, etc.  PHEW.  Back to art.

In art, something similar is at work.  The most abstract definition of art might be any artifice that doesn&#8217;t directly aid in human survival.  It&#8217;s what&#8217;s done in the time when we aren&#8217;t building shelter, tools, and foraging for food.  We&#8217;d put that at the top of our Art *class *diagram.  It&#8217;s an extremely broad definition of Art, but it works.   Perhaps three classes inherit from the main Art class (many more do but we&#8217;re keeping it simple).  Painting, Architecture, Sculpture.  The Painting class describes any pigment applied to a flat surface, Architecture describes the non-functional parts of buildings, and Sculpture is material crafted in 3-dimensions.

Ok, this is where it gets interesting.  We can just say a Sculpture is a 3-D object and not &#8220;a 3-D object made for the aesthetic appreciation and edification of humankind blah blah blah&#8221; because the Sculpture class already inherits all of the properties of Art, and we&#8217;ve already defined Art.  Still with me?

So now we can elaborate on this forever.  What sorts of classes inherit from the Painting class?  Oil On Canvas class?  Portrait class?  A Renaissance class?  Now what sorts of objects can be made from these classes?  *Mona Lisa?*

Let&#8217;s go back to the *object *called *You See Right Through Me. *From what *class *does this *object *inherit its properties?  Perhaps the Performance class.  From what class does the Performance class inherit its properties?  Let&#8217;s say the Conceptual class.  And where does Conceptual get its properties?  Let us say from the Minimalist class.  The Minimalist class may be closely linked to the Sculpture class.

Do you see where I&#8217;m going with this?

The next time the question of &#8220;But is it Art?&#8221; comes up you need to ask yourself what properties it inherits from another, more generalized, class.  There&#8217;s no point arguing that your favorite video game, movie, napkin doodle, soliloquy, or coffee cup is Art.  It is.  It is extended from the very abstract Art class.  What you need to ask is: what tradition, what movement, what school, what area, what *class* is it descended from?  This is a much more productive and useful specification.  You might be perfectly happy knowing  your macramé projects are Art and that&#8217;s it.  The creative project you do for yourself  is one level of artistic specificity.  Perhaps you have a creative project in the permanent collection of a museum.  That is another level of artistic specificity.  Questioning why one project makes it into a museum and another doesn&#8217;t is a perfectly valid inquiry, but it doesn&#8217;t take the artness away from either one.

The point is this:  the &#8220;weird&#8221; or &#8220;eye roll inducing&#8221; art that is hard to understand for some people is not happening in a vacuum.  It is part of a much larger system that can be understood if you take the time.  To deny that an object is not part of Art just because you don&#8217;t see the relationships is being intellectually dishonest and a little ignorant of a large academic field.  The connections and inheritances are there if you&#8217;re interested.
