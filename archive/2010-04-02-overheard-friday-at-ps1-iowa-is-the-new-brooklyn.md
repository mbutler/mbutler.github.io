There were so many amazing things happening Friday night for Mission Creek, but the events surrounding whatever-it-is-you-call-it that happened at PS1 throughout the night transcended it all.  The level of energy, talent, and love pouring from these group of people was palpable.  I wanted to stay for the whole thing but could only pop in and out.  Catching everything leaves it all somewhat blurry, but I&#8217;m left thinking about that *thing* that happened.  Seriously, it was almost like its own musical genre or style or movement or something.
