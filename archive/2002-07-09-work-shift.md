![Work-Shift][1]  
Produced by [Community Architexts][2] Chicago/ Los Angeles  
Visit the Work-Shift [website][3] for more information.  
Read the [script.][4] based on audio and written interviews in the collection of the State Historical Society of Iowa library.

The soundscape is a digital collage which is constructed of layers of archival machine sounds and workers&#8217; voices, submerging and emerging from the noise. The performers have developed a palette of choreographed movements that are either synchronized (based upon actual workers&#8217; repetitive task motions) or improvisational (the opposite of regimented work). Machines are omnipresent in this performance as desired objects, as sounds, as systems both repressive and expressive.

Words are deployed in three ways: 1) A voice-over narrative is a composite of many women&#8217;s stories of the workplace; 2) Projected inscriptions reclaim the site with taxonomies of job names, car names. etc; 3 ) Archival voices are subsumed into the digital soundscapeâ€”they are ghosts in the machine.

The videos projected on the site are either archival film footage of workers (like X-rays into the past of the buildings) or re-creations of actions remembered by former workers. Although we focused upon the work experiences of women, we also included men in outreach.
