The first hours of Easter were ushered in my Iowa City&#8217;s very own The Tanks.  I know Cory Chisel played for a little bit longer at the Mill, but The Tanks show was essentially the cap to a brilliant Mission Creek.  The memories of this night will most certainly contain the infamous smoke bomb and the resulting *confusion*.  This Easter Sunday shall be a day of rest, so I&#8217;ll just leave this right here.
