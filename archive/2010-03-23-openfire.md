I&#8217;m still thinking about [John Fink][1]&#8216;s presentation, **I&#8217;m not here I&#8217;m there &#8212; using a local instant messaging server in your library** at the Library Technology Conference at Macalester College last week.  He is a strong advocate for free software and he reminds me of a young Richard Stallman.  I wasn&#8217;t so jazzed about what seemed like a minor dig at library paraprofessionals, but that was probably just me taking things personally.  He showed up at our presentation right after that, so it&#8217;s all good.  He&#8217;s using [Openfire][2] in his library for messaging.  It look fairly intuitive and I&#8217;m thinking about trying to get it running on my server, cthulhu.

Now to think up a fun use for it other than just *instant messages*.
