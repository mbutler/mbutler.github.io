Over the past few weeks there&#8217;s been a flurry of discussion concerning the pros and cons of Flash and Facebook.  These two platforms, as platforms tend to do, have brought the fanboys out of the woodwork to trash talk anyone who won&#8217;t denounce their personal computing habits.

A platform is a hardware or software architecture that typically competes in the marketplace for users, but the analogy can be extended to any system or rule-set prone to provoking nerdrage.  A prime example of an obnoxious platform war is the bickering that goes on over what current video game console is best, PS3, Xbox 360, or PCs. (Wii typically doesn&#8217;t cut it).  Every fanboy has his favorite and will seemingly die before admitting another platform has any positive qualities.  I&#8217;m not sure why this is, but it probably has something to do with our innate desire to take sides, compete, and not give in to &#8220;others&#8221;.  Also, investing in a platform is expensive in terms of time and money.  To switch after such investment would be humiliating and a waste.

Video games are a competitive, boyish world so these kind of stupid fights make more sense.  When you defend your platform you don&#8217;t consider any negative aspects of your side and you *certainly* don&#8217;t talk about the other side&#8217;s benefits.  But it came as somewhat of a surprise when Flash and Facebook jumped into the fray, with a full-fledged platform war erupting from it.  Fanboys dug in, forgot all common sense, and posted an endless litany of reasons why UR SHIT SUX!!!!1

I try really, really hard not to subscribe to the fanboy newsletter, but let me tell you &#8211; as a Y chromosome carrying geek it&#8217;s tough out there.  I use a lot of this stuff and, of course, develop preferences.  So when someone comes out swinging irrationally against a platform that I&#8217;ve found useful &#8211; it takes a lot of grit not to spit back.

Not to take sides too much here, but the platform that breeds some of the worst fanboys is Apple.  WOW these guys are intense.  I&#8217;ve been a Mac user, a Windows user, and a Linux user so I know my way around each of these platforms (I currently work on iPhone OS, Mac OS, Win 7, Ubuntu 10.04).  I recognize the benefits and drawbacks to each.  They each do some things very well and other things poorly.  But no system has such an army of drones as Apple.  Some days I swear they&#8217;re sent out from Steve Jobs&#8217; volcano lair just to piss all over everyone else&#8217;s computing parade.

I only bring this up because the Macheads are the ones behind so much of the recent Flash hate.  Flash has had a bad name for a while now, so it&#8217;s not just Mac fanboys.  Flash is nowhere near perfect (annoying ads are made in Flash, it&#8217;s kind of closed, it&#8217;s an annoying virtual machine) but to hear the Apple fanboys this month you&#8217;d think Adobe was trying to take away their birthday.  What&#8217;s funny is that many of them had no opinion before or were even mildly insulted that Flash didn&#8217;t make it onto the iPhone.  But now they are apparently experts in Flash and application development!  You can tell the poseurs by their talking points.  Hint:  If you hear the statement &#8220;Everything you can do in Flash you can do in HTML5+CSS3+js&#8221; you might be talking to an Apple fanboy.

Facebook is undergoing the same attacks right now.  Granted, there are some very legitimate privacy concerns being voiced at the moment that shouldn&#8217;t go ignored.  But boy OH BOY the Facebook hatin&#8217; fanboys are eating it up.  Most of them seem to be staunch Twitter users, which makes sense.  Their &#8220;rationale&#8221; usually goes like this:  Facebook SUX cuz it&#8217;s full of ads lolololol suckers!  They&#8217;re forgetting (or ignoring) that Twitter can&#8217;t run for free and will eventually seek funding.

There&#8217;s a bit of elitism going on with their pro-Twitter stance as well.  Twitter has caught on in the academic world, being the darling of the conference going crowd.  It&#8217;s a great way to fire off a thought or a link without having to do to much work.  Facebook, for them, is for commoners who only want to share baby pics and play games.  A Tweet, in some convoluted logic, is *real* work.   Not that Facebook users aren&#8217;t sometimes anti-Twitter, but more likely they just don&#8217;t care.

I&#8217;m trying to use all of the platforms as not to fall into the fanboy trap.  I tweet from my iPhone and Facebook from my boring work PC.  I build apps in Flash and also program in Python.  I play games on my computer and also on an old PS2 and Dreamcast.

So if you&#8217;re reading this and are rabidly against some platform because you&#8217;ve **always** been against it (or worse, haven&#8217;t even used it)  &#8212; knock it off.  Oh, and by the way &#8212;

APPLE SUX A BAG OF DICKS!!!!!!11lololol
