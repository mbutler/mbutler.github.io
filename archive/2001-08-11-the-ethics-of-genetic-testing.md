This was a CD-ROM developed for The University of Iowaâ€™s College of Nursing (in conjunction with National Human Genome Research Institute). It was marketed to nursing educators at the collegiate and hospital staff development levels and included modules on ethics, genetic testing, and case studies on breast cancer and Alzheimer disease. It provided for individually paced, interactive learning with graded quizzes and sample video cases by professional actors. Starting with a 300-page written document we illustrated this text with interactive animations, graphics, video, and sound.
