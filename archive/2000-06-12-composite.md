![Composite][1]  
Composite was a painting installation at the University of Iowa&#8217;s Checkered Space by Nathan Peck, Danielle Johnson, Kelli Spengler, and matt\_butler. Danielle and Kelli created two large vinyl banners with bingo daubers. Nathan produced a series of palm-sized iconic paintings. matt\_ created this computer display to demonstrate a way to classify and access their work via a handcrafted electronic catalog. By clicking on one of the dots a painting appears on the top portion of the screen. If pressed in the correct sequence, different secret video-paintings can be unlocked.
