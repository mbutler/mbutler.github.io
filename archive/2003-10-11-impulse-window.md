Novo Spoor was a new media art installation which set out to investigate the socioinformatics of transitory space. It explored the intersection of traditional animal tracking skills and online usage tracking by examining the footprints left at physical and virtual sites. Using a large format touch screen, Novo Spoor created an &#8220;information cast&#8221; of passersby hand movements which indicated the directionality of their intentions as they foraged for information, food, entertainment, and other resources. All measurements created from each person&#8217;s crossing pattern (photos, votes, preferences) were made available to all others who chose to interact with the installation. The interface consisted of a 61 inch infrared grid which interpreted the hand positions of the user as a mouse event within the software. IR hardware by Impulse Window.
