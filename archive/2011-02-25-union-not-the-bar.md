There&#8217;s been a lot of talk lately about labor unions, spurred on of course by the events in Wisconsin and other states.  As a worker who takes on jobs both with and without union representation, I thought I&#8217;d chime in briefly with my thoughts on the matter.  Currently my time is split at about 75% union work and 25% non-union work.

I&#8217;ve been a member of a labor union since 1999 when I joined COGS UE Local 896 and then later AFSCME as part of my employment at the Iowa City Public Library.  In &#8217;99 I was pretty ignorant about why I needed to join COGS or what my dues were even paying for, but I was interested and willing to give it a shot.  During the semester I began graduate school, the union was locked in a fairly heated battle with the University over delays in TA paychecks.  Some of the teaching and research assistants were going months without pay and the union was rightfully upset by it.  I saw first-hand then how useful the union was for me and the power of collective bargaining.  The union stood up for its members and were able to get the problem solved.  I was sold on their effectiveness.

As a member of AFSCME, I&#8217;m not as active in the union as I&#8217;d like to be but am still a proud member that believes very strongly in collective bargaining and making sure all workers are represented fairly and compensated equitably.  I&#8217;m completely convinced that the only way workers at Wal-Mart, for example, would be able to increase their benefits is to organize and unionize.  There is currently no possible way for the &#8220;lowly employee&#8221; to demand just action from Wal-Mart management without being a member of a collective.

As I mentioned, 25% of my time is also spent running a very small consulting business.  As sole-proprietor, I&#8217;m free to charge what I like for my work, directly pay taxes on the revenue that comes in, and watch as my tiny business succeeds or fails based on my own efforts and skill.  It&#8217;s fun and frustrating.  I do it less for the money and more for the chance at working on interesting projects, but it&#8217;s still a legit company with a tax ID from the federal government and all the joys and headaches that brings.

My feeling is that a lot of people who hate unions own a business or work in a private company and have plans to move up.  They see a better world where everyone competes based on merit and skill and that&#8217;s how we bring out the best work and product.  This is a narrow view of the world.   It might work for the person that is developing his small 25% time business like mine, but this dog-eat-dog mentality just doesn&#8217;t translate to some fields and types of work.

Having worked both union and non-union I wanted to dispel some common myths that I&#8217;ve run across about labor unions.  Please comment if you have something to add or if I&#8217;m making a glaring error.

**Myth: Unions protect bad workers**

Many anti-unionists like to claim that unions make things more inefficient by protecting bad workers.  I haven&#8217;t seen this to be the case.  There is obviously protectionism going on with a unionized group of workers&#8230; that&#8217;s kinda the point.  But in my experience, working in a union environment means *everything *is spelled out in detail and you know exactly what you can and can&#8217;t get away with.  I think this is what gets misunderstood.  In a non-union job you can be fired for pretty much anything.  Boss doesn&#8217;t like you, you&#8217;re gone.  This isn&#8217;t fair and it&#8217;s what unions protect against.  The question is who decides who is a &#8220;bad worker&#8221; or not?  Being in a union simply means you get to sit down at the table with your boss and an arbitrator to decide.  If this is protecting bad workers then you don&#8217;t understand what it&#8217;s like to work in a low-paid or entry level job and not have much power over your own labor.  Try it and see if maybe you want a union on your side.

**Myth: Unions cost more money**

Sometimes they do and sometimes they don&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s my opinion that people&#8217;s wages and benefits are not simply another line on the accounting ledger.  It&#8217;s a special category of expense that needs to be treated with respect.  Unions do not exist in order to drain money away from tax payers and capitalists.  Unions exist to make sure their workers receive a just and dignified wage.  This is not a bad thing.

**Myth: Unions force workers to join**

Maybe some do, I don&#8217;t know every union.  But my rather large union and the one embroiled in the Wisconsin controversy at the moment didn&#8217;t require me to join at all.  I was asked politely by the union rep if I&#8217;d like to join and I was given all the time I needed to decide.  There are people that I work with that have declined and they are never pressured.

There&#8217;s probably more that I could address but I&#8217;ll stop here.
