![speaking binary][1]  
This is a conceptual translation of the sentence “Sometimes I think like a computer.” into binary, where each letter is represented by a string of 8 ones or zeros. 1=YES 0=NO. Some people believe that the entire universe is the result of a series of yes-or-no choices that take place at the quantum level. Others believe the entire universe is contained within the human mind. Some feel that our mind is just a computing device. I haven&#8217;t made up mine yet. Maybe.

Originally produced for [*Uber-Setzung/Trans-lation *][2]at the University of Iowa Museum of Art. It was later used in the [dATAPLOT][3] exhibit at the [SXU gallery][4].
