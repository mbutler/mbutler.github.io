<del>Pale-Glo was an extremely short-lived corporation with high hopes. Our plan was to float our ideas (whatever they might be) in the mass media with the hopes of picking up a little publicity. It was going to be fun to use the corporate workflow and advertising structure to create a digital art project for school. We started gaining just a grain of notoriety when another student in the department, John Fryer, exploded in the international media for <a href="http://www.allmylifeforsale.com">All My Life For Sale</a>. It was great to see one of us go all the way with a class project, but after John was interviewed by Conan O’Brian and his book was optioned by Warner Bros I started to get really pissed at him because I thought we were being graded on the curve. I couldn&#8217;t even get one of our local &#8216;zines to cover me let alone appear on the Today Show. Fortunately we all got an &#8216;A&#8217; anyway. Everybody wins. </del>

[Consciousness ][1] is a quality of the mind generally regarded to comprise qualities such as self-awareness, sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one&#8217;s environment. In common parlance, consciousness denotes being awake and responsive to one&#8217;s environment; this contrasts with being asleep or being in a coma.

Consciousness is notoriously difficult to define or locate. Many cultures and religious traditions place the seat of consciousness in a soul separate from the body. Conversely, many scientists and philosophers consider consciousness to be intimately linked to the neural functioning of the brain.

An understanding of necessary preconditions for consciousness in the human brain may allow us to address important ethical questions. For instance, to what extent are non-human animals conscious? At what point in fetal development does consciousness begin? Can machines ever achieve conscious states? These issues are of great interest to those concerned with the ethical treatment of other beings, be they animals, fetuses, or in the future, machines.

The term &#8216;pale-glo&#8217; refers to the barely perceptible emissions from our own thinking process.

This was our first attempt at controlling [ brainwaves ][5] through various frequencies and hypnotic effects embedded in music. Many of the tracks also contain subliminal messages and induced [ EVP recordings.][6]
