We all know chess is great. It&#8217;s one of the most playtested strategy games in the world, having been around for 800 years with hundreds of thousands of fully documented games. It perfectly balanced with crystal clear internal logic.  Chess has no fluff, no cruft, and the rules have been honed over centuries by the most genius minds that have ever lived.  But I have single-handedly decided it&#8217;s time for chess to be replaced with&#8230;. *a game I invented in one afternoon*!!

Dungeon does for fantasy RPG encounters what chess does for battlefield strategy. It&#8217;s a very distilled, abstract representation of the classic fighter, cleric, thief, and wizard stumbling upon a lair of monsters guarding a treasure. There were a few constraints I had before coming up with dungeon.  The game:

*   must use roughly the same number of pieces as chess
*   must not use specialized pieces, only standard board game pieces.
*   must use a grid
*   must be able to be documented through algebraic notation
*   rules must be roughly equal in complexity as chess
*   must be two player only

As of the 0.2 beta release of the rules it is completely unplaytested and therefore horribly balanced I&#8217;m sure.  Please take a look at the game here if it pleases you.  Test it and tell me what&#8217;s wrong.  [The rules can be downloaded for free.][2] You don&#8217;t have to buy the game since it uses standard board game parts, but the pieces have been bundled together for your convenience.  I&#8217;m making $0.06 profit on each one of these babies!
