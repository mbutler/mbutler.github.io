**Summary **  
&#8220;MICA-TV&#8217;s Cascade (vertical landscapes) is an example of a very different kind of video work, with constantly panning and shifting camera work creating a dialogue between architecture and landscape. Michael Smith&#8217;s humorous piece uses the camera work and production values of commercial television to very different ends. Paul Garrin&#8217;s video both documents an incident of police brutality in New York and further explores political activism and protest through the use of video&#8221;&#8211;Insert.  
In Conversations Vito Acconci, with Steven Poser, delivers an interesting talk, almost a performance, about his work.
