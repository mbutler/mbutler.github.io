In collaboration with textile artist Ursula McCarty, we produced this CD-ROM which documents her work with at-risk teenage girls at the Foundations 2 program in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Ursula spent several weeks at the shelter with the girls sewing a personally expressive quilt that covered an entire car. The car was then part of the Art on Wheels exhibition at CSPS in Cedar Rapids. We videotaped much of their progress and integrated that video along with text, music, and photos to create an interactive document of the project.
