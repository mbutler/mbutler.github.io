If you’ve spent any length of time in our fair city you’ve probably noticed we have a healthy and vibrant drinking culture.  The cool kids here like to go out and have their PBRs or high-quality craft beers or Jagerbombs or whatever.  Along with the celebrating (who-knows-what) comes the inevitable and dreaded Public Intoxication arrest &#8211; a misdemeanor so varied in its applicability some are left to wonder what it actually means.  To the knowledgeable, public intox means you were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  To the less informed it automatically means you were blacked out face-down in the middle of Linn St.  It’s a very wide range but let’s look at the law.

**According to Iowa Code section 123.46**

You can be arrested if you are drunk or *pretending* to be drunk in a public place.  What is drunk (or pretend drunk) and what is public you ask?  Drunk means your reason or mental ability has been affected, judgement impaired, emotions visibly excited, or you’ve lost control of bodily actions.  Public place means streets, parking lots, steps of apartment buildings, dorms, bars, and event centers.  So that means you can technically be arrested if you’re emotionally excited in a bar.  Woo hoo.  Bring on the fun. Hope you hate music.

You also probably know you have some rights if you’re ever caught with a buzz on someplace besides locked in your bedroom with the shades pulled.  See, there’s a thing called the 5th Amendment.  This means you can’t be forced to be a witness against yourself.  It roughly translates into “DON’T TALK TO THE COPS.”  If they ask you if you’ve been drinking you don’t have to answer.  You also get to refuse a breath test.  You may instead request an independent chemical test.  Oh, and the cop can’t order you into public either if you’re not already.

Now that that’s clear, let’s move on to how the police will lie to you and trick you into invalidating one of those rights.  Of course your mileage may vary depending on your skin color.

The police (in their unending interest to protect and serve us) have developed a series of tactics to trick the citizenry into getting arrested.  If you don’t believe me, just ask anyone who’s been at the ass end of one of these bogus public intox charges.  It happens more than you think and there’s not a damn thing you can do about it except hopelessly whine to the Council or Police Citizen’s Review Board.

There’s no way to prove this conspiracy theory except share stories of dumb Public Intox arrests.
