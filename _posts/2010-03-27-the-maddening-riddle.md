I was reminded of this tonight for some reason.  This cryptic riddle appeared in January 2006 on an online forum that I used to frequent.  This particular community was made up of some very bright folks who were known for figuring out difficult problems.  No one could hack this riddle.  The thread quickly died but I was consumed with the puzzle.  *What the hell is the answer? *I couldn&#8217;t think about much else for many days while my brain chewed madly on the riddle and producing a solution.  I remember staying up into the wee hours of the morning poring over my insane notes, never stopping until it was solved.  Google was no help.  The forum was no help.  No living person could help.  I was alone in my journey.  There were dozens of dead-ends that sent me straight back to the beginning to start over.  I remember reaffirming my conviction that we live in a godless universe.

The riddle didn&#8217;t exist on Google at the time and [a new Google search][1] produces a bit more information.  No one seems to know where it came from or what the answer is.  It looks like someone did figure out that it could be referring to syllables.  But the &#8216;syllables&#8217; answer still doesn&#8217;t seem to fit, though it is vastly more elegant than my answer.  I promised myself that I wouldn&#8217;t become reinfatuated with this riddle if I revisited it tonight, so I won&#8217;t.  The consensus among the forum members that were also trying to solve it was that it was some kind of online trickery or a unique way of testing how memes spread online.  I posted my answer at 3 a.m. a couple of days later to the same forum and was roundly mocked for having lost my mind.  Anyway, here&#8217;s my batshit insane solution.  Remember, this was after days of delirium and relentless pursuit of an answer that can never be.

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;

I think this riddle tells the story of a woman who is out with her lover while her husband and kids are at home.  She can&#8217;t decide what man to be with or even who the father of her children are.  She must get back to put all her kids to bed because she plans to murder one of the men in his sleep.

It uses the chess board to help illustrate this narrative.  It also describes a chess problem and variant.  The Queen must capture 6 pieces (putting the kids to bed) then checkmate one of the kings.

The numbers 6, 8, and 18?  The sum equals the number of pieces in chess.

The pronouns refer to both men, women, and children as well as chess terms.

*One man has six of them, two men have 8.*  
&#8220;Them&#8221; means children.  One of the men has six (children), (but) they (kings) both have 8 (problems; the 6 kids, the woman, and the other man). This means one player would have a king (man) and six pieces (children) while the other player has a king (man) and a queen (woman).  The woman must leave the single man to return home.

*If women have them, they are halved.*  
We&#8217;ve already figured out how many pieces are on the board.  Now we have to find out their value.  &#8220;Them&#8221; now refers to the men.  It also refers to the traditional chess point values.  queen=9, rook=5, bishop and knight=3, pawn=1, king=0.  So if the woman has a man (queen and king) then the point value is half of the other players.  If the king (man) is worthless then the player with the queen has nine (points).  Or in other words, the other player has twice as many at 18 points.  That takes us to the next line.

*If children use them, they have 18*  
&#8220;Them&#8221; again is men.  The children are the 6 lesser pieces that the queen mother must put to bed. They total 18 points.  A bishop(dei) and a knight(night) worth 6 total.  Now there&#8217;s 4 more pieces that must equal 12.  Two of each.  Two rooks and two pawns to make a total of 18 points.

*I have none, but you have several.*  
The I and you is confusing because we never know who is who.  It must be equally true for both of the kings.  When the children are captured then the woman decides who she will murder, making this statement true for one of the men.  One man who is worthless has no points while the other king who is worthless has the queen has several.

*They are red at day and black at night.*  
Day and Night, Awake and Asleep, putting the children to bed, sleeping around  
red and black, alive and dead, birth and death, love and murder  
night sounds like knight and day sounds like dei, as in god.  see above.
