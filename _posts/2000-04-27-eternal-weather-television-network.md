This video is dedicated to everyone with religious devotion to graphical and media representations of nature. It attempts to look at the Weather Channel from a spiritual standpoint while taking a scientific view on Eternal Word TV. For this initial proof-of-concept, I merely juxtaposed the soundtracks of each video. In the future I&#8217;d like to create radar graphics and data that suggested perhaps gods were responsible for the weather. In turn, I&#8217;d create a slideshow of scenery set to choir music praising meteorology facts and figures.
