&#8220;In the late sixties and early seventies Hans Haacke carried out a series of polls involving visitors to private and public art galleries, and other art institutions such as Documenta 5, 1972. For all but two of these surveys, Haacke used a questionnaire with ten demographic questions on age, religion, sex, income, etc., and ten questions on current social and political problems. The &#8220;Visitors&#8217; Profile&#8221; (1971), compiled during the exhibition &#8220;Directions 3: Eight Artists&#8221; at the Milwaukee Art Center, also follows this pattern.&#8221; &#8212; Generali Foundation
