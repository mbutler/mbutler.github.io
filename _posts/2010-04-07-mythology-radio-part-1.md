In 1984, after watching far too much *Clash of the Titans (1981) *on HBO*, *I became obsessed with communicating with Greek gods and possibly traveling to the legendary Mount Olympus.  My child mind regarded the gods and demigods as quite real and I remember having an argument with my father over this.  He claimed they were not real (probably correct) while by my reasoning they were as real as Jesus Christ if an entire civilization believed in them (controversial).  In a vain attempt at proving my point, I set out to build a radio in order to make contact with them and settle the matter once and for all.

I had a relatively long history with disassembling electronics in the futile hope their magical essences would transfer to whatever device I could construct with the parts.  I had no formal training in electrical engineering at the age of 10, but I was still convinced I could come close enough to a working prototype to make my efforts worthwhile.  A trail of several failed robots lay behind me on my path to becoming an electronics genius.  I quickly learned that gluing various parts together from my dad&#8217;s shed was not enough for a functioning robot &#8211; there were many other connections that needed to be made it seemed.  My knowledge of programming languages was also insufficient to create a suitable AI.  My most advanced piece of software being &#8220;Fat Boys vs. The Transformers&#8221;, a quirky program that played a robotic sounding version of the rap group The Fat Boys whenever someone would push an arbitrary button on my Tandy Color Computer 3.

So to construct my Mythology Radio required a special component.  The missing piece, I figured, was that I was choosing the wrong components and programming it in the wrong way.  In order to actually talk with Greek gods, I&#8217;d need:

*   parts from a radio
*   parts from an electronic toy that I held dear
*   a ritual to bring it to life (the programming)

The radio part was obvious.  The valued toy electronics was, if I remember, something like a sacrifice &#8211; an offering to the gods.  The ritual was needed to show them that I was very serious about my endeavors and not to be taken lightly.

I set to to work finding junk electronic parts from a transistor radio, an an old Speak-and-Spell (it seemed so obvious at the time why, but I&#8217;ve since forgotten the reasoning), and finding a ritual.  I didn&#8217;t know very many rituals, so I settled on doing what I did best &#8211; staring at stuff and thinking about it really, REALLY hard.  That always made things seem so real.  I glued everything to a board, propping the circuit board up with a little plastic thing to make it look more developed and then set to concentrating.

My visualization techniques involved squinting really hard, staring at the object, and thinking intently about the gods.  There was smoke and robes, jewels and mechanical owls,  Harry Hamlin and a stop-motion Medusa.

I think it worked, I can&#8217;t really remember.  I remember spending more time trying to convince my family of disbelievers that it worked more than actually communicating with Zeus.  A little more refinement and I&#8217;m sure I could have gotten it up and running for real.

In honor of the remake of the *Clash of the Titans*, I&#8217;ve decided to remake my Mythology Radio &#8211; this time getting it right.  I&#8217;ve found the perfect electronic component.  This baby:
