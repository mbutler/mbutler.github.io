Preachcricket produces beatcentric electronic music for radios and parties.

We took over the Monday night 10pm slot on Iowa City Free Radio from DJ Trainwreck and Rook Brut (both now in Chicago). That was spring 2001. In 2003 we came up with the name Preachcricket by rolling it randomly with the band name generator appendix in the paper-and-pencil RPG &#8220;So You Want to Be a Rock and Roll Star.&#8221; &#8216;Sparklebook&#8217; was a close second. Mix tapes being uploaded now.
