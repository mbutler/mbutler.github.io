After one final push last night, I finally finished the music library metadata cleanup project at around 2 AM.   I needed to finish this up because after nearly a fortnight of working on this daily it was beginning to deter other work.  Also, I was losing sight of the original intent which was not only to clean the metadata but also weed the collection.  Many of these songs were downloaded in a time when mp3s were still scarce and we couldn&#8217;t just jump on YouTube to hear that one-hit wonder we want once and a while.  I became obsessed with running down all of the albums instead of just throwing away ones I didn&#8217;t listen to &#8211; so that&#8217;s precisely what I did.

I was down to around 900 files untagged, all of which were mostly unlistened to on any regular basis.  I just trashed these.  It only amounted to 5% of my total library, which seemed reasonable.   I now have ~3,500 albums &#8211; all with complete tags and album artwork.  It feels good.

I learned quite a bit about my musical tastes throughout this.  There are certain types of tracks that I came to loathe throughout this process.  For example:  Stupid raver mixes from the turn of the century, endless oldies from the 50&#8217;s and 60&#8217;s, obnoxious country songs from an unknown origin, inane gangsta rap crap from no-name MCs,  and whiny indie boy bands.  I like each of those genres to an extent, but it was enlightening to learn every genre has plenty of examples of weak songs.  By the end I was much less forgiving about saving music.  Oh look &#8211; it&#8217;s &#8220;Fuk dis Club Up&#8221; by someone named Lil&#8217; Damien.  DELETE.  Oh what is this called?  &#8220;Country Boy dun Good&#8221; by Jackson Jennings or whatever.  DIE.  &#8220;Space Orbit XTC Mix vol. 19&#8243; by DJ Unknown Asshole.  YOU NEVER HAPPENED.

As a final act of cleansing I:

*   paid iTunes store to remove the DRM from any song I&#8217;ve purchased ($55)
*   converted every non-mp3 file to mp3
*   deleted all  AAC, AIF, WAV, RM, MOV, WMA file in the entire music directory
*   ran a small script to delete every empty directory and subdirectory in the music folder
*   deleted several directories with only album art or playlists

Having purged the cruft I can now responsibly add and tag albums and songs as they come in.  A 10-year dream has finally been realized and I can finally get to some of those projects that were part of my New Year&#8217;s resolutions that are now two weeks late.
