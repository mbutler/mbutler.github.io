**Day Twelve**

STILL GOING.  I&#8217;m happy to say I&#8217;ve finished up all of the complete albums and I&#8217;m now on to all of the messy individual tracks.  This is the barren wasteland of tagging that I&#8217;ve been dreading this entire project, but also the section of the library that needed the most work.  It is tedious, frustrating, and prone to error&#8230; but worth it.  Despite many false promises of project completion, I can actually see a light at the end of the tunnel.  I have ~1,400 files left to tag &#8211; all of them in the dreaded &#8216;Unknown Album&#8217; subdirectory.  I&#8217;m tempted to just grab 500 at a time and throw them at TuneUp but there are enough automatic tagging errors that it&#8217;s not worth it.  I&#8217;m now sending 5-8 at a time, quickly verifying that the results are ballpark, then calling it good.  This will have to be the trade off.  Once these 1,400 files are done I&#8217;ll still have more work to do to make sure every track has artwork.  This could be easy or painful, I&#8217;m not sure.  At least there is a artwork lookup tool built in that will help.

I have other pressing projects that are suffering because of this.  Web sites that people are waiting for and willing to give me money to complete but I shall remain undeterred until the music library is as clean as hospital sheets.  It is a decade in the making and nothing will stop me!
