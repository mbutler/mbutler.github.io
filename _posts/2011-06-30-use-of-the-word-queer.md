I totally forgot I wrote this for a project by [ACE = Art Culture Experiments][1] back in 2008 and just stumbled across it on Google. It was prompted by a controversial use of the word &#8216;queer&#8217; and various artists and writers were asked to contribute a blurb about it. Unsurprisingly, mine ended up being overly technical. 

*&#8220;What are your thoughts on Queer?&#8221;*

&#8220;A [naming collision][2] is a circumstance where two or more identifiers in a given namespace or a given scope cannot be unambiguously resolved, and such unambiguous resolution is a requirement of the underlying system.&#8221;

It seems to me that the identifier becomes ambiguous when used outside of either heteronormative or LGBT communities. Depending on the community, it can be used positively or negatively. It&#8217;s probably most confusing when used by people who don&#8217;t strongly identify with either community and are unsure of how their use of the word will be perceived. My feeling is that the only way to reduce ambiguity is to always default to a positive connotation that represents pride, acceptance and love. Further use of in this way, particularly in public contexts where a naming collision is likely, will help to clearly define the word for confused individuals. It is clear that the pejorative use of has been deprecated and should be avoided.
