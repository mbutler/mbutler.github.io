![ALLOY][1]  
ALLOY >KIND TRICKS and BODILY REALITIES in the VANGUARD PARTY

There has been quite a bit of work done up to this point on computer generated writing. From the sophisticated and serious attempts at natural language generation to the silly online cut-up scripts for creating nonsense poetry. Sure, there have been real improvements in the field of informatics, but what advances have the poets and artists made? In the early part of the 20th century, Tristan Tzara created the first Dada poem by cutting up a newspaper then drawing the random scraps from a hat. This act was supremely radical in its ascription of meaning onto chance operations but it seems &#8220;chance&#8221; in art has been played out for some time now. Computation has extended the life of this artistic endevour by a few years, but again, we are at the end of the road of chance operation in art and poetry. It simply does not produce aesthetically pleasing output &#8211; even for those familiar with its historical traditions. So what can be done? 

**The first 100 words:** &#8220;*Electricity and death, intimacy, of an imaginative resource guessing something in the center. We have a means for inanimate objects to enter the polarity and the need for connection of thought and the dreamy Savannas, through its power, it moves; a tea-party for emergence; wherever there still insisting on the power and other forms the certainty of the spiritual wave sends out similar thoughts which we engage in a quest myth are a vibration of an intimacy, the materialization of his linear vectors or stable expression of vision ray freedom of conciousness. By the right technique of the dense pattern of mind*.&#8221;
