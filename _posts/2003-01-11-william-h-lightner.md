![William H. Lightner][1]<img /

This documentary, directed and written by Bart Brat, chronicles the life and work of visionary artist William H. Lightner. Lightner was a professional wrestler and engineer who constructed Our Mother of Sorrows Grotto on the campus of Mount Mercy College. I edited this video from the extensive video and audio research done by Bart and also produced a DVD for festival purposes.
