Hello-  
We didn&#8217;t get to talk much at Xxxxxx&#8217;s party, and I&#8217;ve been  
very busy and not had alot of time to send much mail, so here it goes.  
Congratulations on going to grad school. Your mom wasn&#8217;t sure  
what your degree is in, so let me know. I don&#8217;t think I would have the  
patience to go to grad school. I&#8217;ve met too many people with multiple  
degrees in studio art and they seem to be more obsessed with letting  
people know their academic background than actually using their degrees!  
But these are the same people who would rather tell me what the artist  
was doing or feeling when they did the painting, instead of just  
enjoying the way it looks. Xxxxx is a little (no &#8211; alot) like this.  
She is the art historian of the family. Xxxx can&#8217;t stand her analysis  
of everything. Oh well, I&#8217;m sure you will do fine and have a great  
time! Good Luck.
