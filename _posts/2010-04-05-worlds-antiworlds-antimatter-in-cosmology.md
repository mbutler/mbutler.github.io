Let&#8217;s just keep the book-stealing confessions going.  In early 1988 I illegally removed the book [Worlds-Antiworlds: Antimatter in Cosmology][1] by Hannes Alfven from the Fort Madison Junior High Library.  I&#8217;m not sure when it was processed by the library into their collection, but the book was published in 1966.  It was added under the call number 523.1 Alfv.  The slim non-fiction book was hardbound with a plastic dust jacket protecting the exterior.  Since this was before any digital systems or anti-theft devices all I had to do was put it in my bag and leave.  That is precisely what I did.

I remember looking at the book many times while browsing the library.  What made the theft especially shocking is that, like my Words and Spaces book theft, I worked at the library from where I stole it.  I checked it out two times before committing the crime.  Once on Dec 1, 1987 then again on Dec 22, 1987.  Also, like the Words and Spaces book, not a single person checked it out before I did.

1.  No one wanted it but me
2.  It was highly relevant to my research interests at the time
3.  The collection needed weeding anyway
4.  No one wanted it but me

These are, of course, poor justification for stealing from a library.  I haven&#8217;t taken any books since Words and Spaces (that I remember but if I do I&#8217;ll post it here).  I currently work at a library and if any of my co-workers are reading this &#8211; rest assured I haven&#8217;t stolen from you.

But as a digression, why was a book by a Nobel Prize winner on particle physics in the collection of a Junior High library?  It wasn&#8217;t really appropriate for 12 or 13 year olds, unless you were me.  I don&#8217;t say that because I&#8217;m cocky just that I was watching a lot of Doctor Who at the time and working on my own plans for time travel.  Worlds-Antiworlds seemed like the perfect textbook to help me in that research.  Every Friday when Dr. Who came on I&#8217;d pull out the book and flip through it occasionally to get ideas.  It, naturally, contained all sorts of incomprehensible charts and graphs that would have eventually made it into the plans for my time machine.  One chart in particular really stood out and I came back to it again and again.

> Table 1. Extremely Large and Extremely Small Numbers

It ranged from the order of magnitude of the trillions (prefix tera) to the order trillionth (prefix pico).  At the time I was only familiar with the orders micro, milli, kilo, and mega.  Giga and tera seemed exotic and far-off, the stuff only comprehensible in the 21st century.  Nano was equally bizarre.  The movie Back to the Future came out in 1985 and contained a reference to &#8220;1.21 gigawatts&#8221; (pronounced jiga in those days) so I knew the billion scale was on its way but couldn&#8217;t really wrap my mind around it.  Now, in 2010, in amazes me that this table from 1966 seems quaint and inadequately small.

I&#8217;m not going to return this one to the FMJH library.  Kids these days probably know all of the particle physics in it anyway.  It is the 21st century after all.
