Like Saussure’s ‘arbitrariness of the sign,’ Levi-Strauss believes there is no natural connection between an element of a myth and a particular meaning. It is only through the combination of mythical elements that any meaning can be found. By discovering the patterns of these elements in a myth, only then is there significance. His example of the evil grandmother is instructive. By looking solely at this figure without regard for her relationship with the other elements of the myth, any meaning could potentially be attributed to her. If we examine how the evil grandmother is combined with other elements in the myth, we can discover, through their relationship, what meaning the myth holds.

Game changer!
