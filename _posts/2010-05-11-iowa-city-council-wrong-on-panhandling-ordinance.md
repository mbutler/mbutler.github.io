    I know the council feels they are acting fairly and rationally by moving panhandling to sanctioned areas. They&#8217;ve stated several times that they are trying to strike a balance between the needs of donation seekers and business owners. However, as has been demonstrated in the past, rich people have more weight than poor people when it comes to tipping the scales with this council. The balancing act they purport to work so hard for is overwhelmingly in favor of the Downtown Association and well-to-do consumers.

    As is too often the case, it takes dozens of citizens speaking out and protesting in order to offset the one or two overly sensitive people complaining about the &#8220;undesirables&#8221; of this town. It&#8217;s embarrassing for Iowa City, and as Mike Wright correctly put it, &#8220;mean and small-minded&#8221;.

    Terry Dickens, council member and downtown business owner, stated that he&#8217;s had customers &#8220;flee the ped mall to his store to escape the aggressive panhandling&#8221;. He also went on to state &#8220;you people aren&#8217;t downtown everyday like I am&#8221;. His statements demonstrate just how out-of-touch he is with reality. The vast majority of people who are downtown everyday feel perfectly comfortable walking, shopping, visiting, and enjoying this public area. It&#8217;s simply absurd to call the panhandling &#8220;out of control&#8221; and aggressive.

    Over a dozen people, many who live and work downtown every day, showed up last night to demonstrate to the council that not one citation has been written for aggressive panhandling, despite Mr. Dickens&#8217; insistence that it&#8217;s a regular problem. Most people who are downtown regularly know how overstated and exaggerated these aggressive panhandling claims are. It&#8217;s just NOT happening, yet the council continues to defy reality and insist that it is. There are no police records, no citations, no formal complaints&#8230; only the anecdotes of a couple of rich shoppers.

    The ped mall is a public commons. It&#8217;s meant for everyone. As long as you are obeying the law you are welcome &#8211; even if your hair is messy and you smell kinda funny. However the message this council is sending to Iowa City residents is that you are only welcome if you&#8217;re there to spend money. This is not the Iowa City many of us moved here for. It&#8217;s a shame and sends our town in the wrong direction.
