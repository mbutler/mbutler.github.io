*Edit:  I just re-read this a few hours later and I think it comes off far more harsh than I intended.  I&#8217;m gonna leave it, but take it with a grain of salt &#8212; especially if you are a writer and/or reader of fiction. <img src="http://mattbutler.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />*

I was thinking again today about an off-hand tweet I made a few weeks ago:

> I don&#8217;t read novels because I have my own daydreams. Sorry fiction writers.

Perhaps it comes off as glib, but I really do feel this way and it&#8217;s not entirely to be antagonistic towards the bountiful harvest of fiction writers in our fair City of Literature.  I honestly don&#8217;t understand why people spend so much time fawning over fake stories about other people&#8217;s lives.  This isn&#8217;t a shameful confession nor is it a source of pride; I am curious as to what draws people to other people&#8217;s daydreams.

I&#8217;m not particularly fond of fiction in general.  I don&#8217;t watch a ton of movies and I&#8217;m bored easily by most TV shows.  I do enjoy video games though my favorites aren&#8217;t the highly narrative AAA titles that are most popular.  I love non-fiction.  The real world is infinitely more interesting to me than the world of speculation and make-believe.  Fiction asks me to sit still for hours at a time while someone else dumps the contents of their imagination into mine.  Why should I stand for this?  I can easily sit on the couch for hours at a time and invent my own stories, characters, fantastic geographies, interesting dialogue, scenarios, etc.  I can easily imagine crime, outer space, detectives, spies, romance, mystery, horror, monsters, lovers, travels, adventure, absurdity, comedy, philosophy, blah, blah.  I probably don&#8217;t need someone else to do it for me.

I understand that being exposed to other people&#8217;s thoughts (in fiction form) is important because I can&#8217;t possible think of everything &#8212; I get that.  The last novel I read was in 1999, over a decade ago.  Cryptonomicon was brilliant and *certainly *contained imaginations I could never dream of.  But I constantly found my mind wandering off imagining things that I found even more spectacular.  In 2008 I tried to read another novel and found the same thing occurring.  Perhaps it&#8217;s the linearity that bothers me more than the fiction, but I don&#8217;t find this happening with the non-fiction I read (and I read a lot of non-fiction).  A non-fiction book represents the hard work and research that I can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t do.  Fiction represents the culmination of work I do already in my mind.

This sentiment was recently summed up nearly perfectly in David Shields&#8217; manifesto *Reality Hunger*.  Some of us are looking for a new kind of story.  One that doesn&#8217;t hit us over the head with regurgitated tales from 100+ years ago.  While this may seem like an insult to anyone striving to perfect the craft of fiction writing, I assure you it&#8217;s not.  It&#8217;s a call to action and a highly relevant critique of 21st century storytelling.
