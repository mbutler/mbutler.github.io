Psychic Cheese is a quirky piece of online fiction that expresses the desire for personal transformation. Blending self-help rhetoric with tongue-in-cheek metaphysics, the pseudo-corporate interface allows the user to “level up” their psychic abilities by interacting with a special device available for download. The Psychic Cheese users manual mirrors popular directives for empowerment a la hypnosis and neuro-linguistic programming products. Though Psychic Cheese is based on actual principles and might actually function as promised, its overarching purpose is as a critique of the inane world of online quackery. 

But if you don&#8217;t believe it, read [this][4] article.
