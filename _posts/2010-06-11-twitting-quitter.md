Announcing this on a blog that no one reads seems appropriate.

Twitter is just not that fascinating.  I tried, I really did.  But I just don&#8217;t need the noise that network creates in my life.  After a solid couple of months of using it regularly I quit.  It&#8217;s just an unending stream of out-of-context messages, inane quotes, mental farts, and worst of all &#8211; proclamations and spam from some seriously self-absorbed people.  It seems like it&#8217;s perfect for academics and artists who find Facebook too folksy and quotidian.  That&#8217;s great.  Good for them.

I&#8217;ve also never been big on celebrity worship, so knowing what famous people are doing doesn&#8217;t captivate me either.  It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m opposed to all of it.  I think it&#8217;s great for certain types of people.  It just doesn&#8217;t hold my attention.  There&#8217;s no opportunity for discussion or hashing over things with people you know or would at least like to know.

For now I&#8217;ll stick to Facebook for real friends and the various forums and boards for everything else.
