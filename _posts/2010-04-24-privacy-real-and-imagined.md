There&#8217;s a pretty interesting discussion about privacy &#8220;raging&#8221; between some people I&#8217;m following on Twitter right now.  It&#8217;s primarily focused on the new Facebook settings and their business deals which went into effect this week.  You can get a biased low-down these changes [here][1].

One camp says this is no big deal &#8211; you signed up for Facebook and they are under no obligation to respect your privacy.  They need to make money and so they&#8217;re bound to strike deals with advertisers.

The other camp says this is a violation of an implicit Netizen&#8217;s Bill of Rights.  You should be entitled to a level of privacy where online services can&#8217;t share your information with third parties.  I think.  Actually, I&#8217;m not sure what the real position here is.  I&#8217;ll update this when I have more information.

If you&#8217;ll let Father Time have his moment for a second, let me tell you about being &#8220;online&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been consistently using electronic forums, communities, bulletin boards, websites, or social networks now for 20 years.  From roughly 1990-2010.  It began when I was a teen, secretly calling up strange BBSes long distance in the middle of the night and having no idea who was on the other end or what they could do to me.  Everyone, of course, used a handle and real identities were not exchanged, but you never knew who was watching or tracing your call.  In &#8217;92 I got on the internet for reals, finally gaining access to a Sun System.  I got my first email and telneted for the first time, mostly to ISCA.  ISCA was a large, globally recognized telnet BBS right here in Iowa City.  I watched friends meet future spouses online (which was supremely radical back in the early 90&#8217;s), and many friends made.  It was exciting.  Not long after that the web was born and opened the doors to what we know today. I estimate I&#8217;ve had almost 100 online identities in the last couple of decades.

I&#8217;ve seen some really, really shocking shit online in those years.  Of course there are the disgusting images and the realization that people are a whole lot more fucked up than you think.  But I&#8217;ve also seen some amazing internet detective skills &#8211; serious levels of online stalking starting with only the faintest digital trace.  Seriously, that one post you dashed off 10 years ago is still around (even if YOU can&#8217;t find it on Google) and could be the muddy footprint leading right to your real identity. Most of us live by a &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221; model.  We tell ourselves, &#8220;oh why would anyone care about little old me&#8221;.  Well, they don&#8217;t.  *Until they do. *You have no way of knowing who may want your info in the future.

We shouldn&#8217;t have to accept a &#8220;If you&#8217;re not doing anything wrong you have nothing to hide&#8221; mentality.  I&#8217;m not doing anything wrong when I take a shit but that doesn&#8217;t mean I want to share it with the world.  We *are* entitled to privacy, and that extends to the online world.  It&#8217;s just up to us to enforce it, not make it someone else&#8217;s job.

I like Facebook quite a bit.  First, it&#8217;s basically a layer of abstraction between my email and a &#8220;friend&#8217;s&#8221; email who I may want to be in contact with but don&#8217;t know very well.  I really enjoy this aspect of the service.  Secondly, I get invited to more parties and events than I ever would have before.  This is pretty cool for a shut-in nerd like myself.  Third, I actually stay in contact with the pseudo-IRL-friends better.  We joke and chat on each others&#8217; comments and walls whereas we&#8217;d normally go months without contact.  That&#8217;s pretty cool.

But the party can&#8217;t go on forever at no cost.  The bandwidth and development and admin time to update tens of millions of messages in real-time is large.  They MUST pay for this eventually.  Sticking some ads on the sidebar isn&#8217;t enough.  Facebook is trying to get creative with their licensing and ad revenue by building an ad network similar to Google&#8217;s.  To be scared of this is to be scared of what Google does with your searches.  And frankly, my Google searches are **WAY** more sensitive and private than what I put on Facebook.  So if people don&#8217;t want a subscription, which has already been an outcry, then they need to implement something like this.

The reason Facebook did away with fan pages is so they can integrate that with a more ubiquitous &#8216;Like&#8217; button that can be embedded *everywhere*.  I think this is cool.  I&#8217;ve read the developer specs and it&#8217;s designed really nicely.  The scare here is that Facebook has become the de facto standard for social networking, so spreading the Like button around gives many more parties access to your information &#8211; unless you turn that off.  Having said that, Facebook has given us a pretty decent amount of control on this.  It was a little sneaky to turn access to profile info on by default when they added the new feature, but now you know you can turn it off.  Please do, because you have no idea who that third party is.

I&#8217;ll say it:  **Don&#8217;t tell Facebook anything you don&#8217;t want your boss, parents, spouse, or advertiser to know. **It&#8217;s really that simple.

You&#8217;re putting your information out there and you should manage it well.  YOU are in control of your privacy, not a dang website.
