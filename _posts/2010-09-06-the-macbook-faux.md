Last week Melody purchased a shiny new 13&#8243; MacBook Pro for school.  These things, as much as I love to hate them, are really beautiful.  The molded aluminum, the insanely bright and crisp LCD screen, the clean edges, the no hassle hardware configuration&#8230; the list goes on.  I can see why people love them so much and why they&#8217;re willing to pay an absurd amount of money to own one.  Anyway, I inherited the old Acer Extensa 4420 that we purchased a couple of years ago.  My plan was to transform it into a cheap knock-off version of the expensive MacBook Pro.

The Acer isn&#8217;t bad.  It&#8217;s a 1.9 Ghz dual-core Intel with 2 GB of RAM.  Plenty of power to get work done and a better alternative for web-browsing since it sucks less power than my huge, overwrought tower.  Plus it was only $300.

Step-by-step Conversion process:

1.  backup all user files
2.  delete factory installed drive partitions
3.  format hard drive
4.  install Windows Vista Ultimate 32-bit edition
5.  check Device Manager for missing drivers
6.  Go to Acer driver download page and download all necessary drivers from another computer
7.  discover the wireless driver on Acer page doesn&#8217;t work
8.  spend 4 hours installing/uninstalling several drivers (via usb) found on questionable websites
9.  discover an obscure driver package from Dell (R174291.exe) being shared on RapidShare
10. run the R174291.exe setup and watch it fail
11. start manual driver install and point it at an internal folder within R174291
12. with restored internet connection, install AVG and run windows updates (should have installed AVG *before *messing with shady drivers)
13. run all windows updates and wait for 1.5 hours as 89 updates download and install
14. turn User Account Control off via msconfig so a custom theme can be installed
15. while msconfig is open, hide the recycle bin from the desktop
16. download and install Vista OS X, a program that auto-configs the theme
17. change the directories in the &#8220;dock&#8221; to point at the correct locations
18. add personal favorite applications (CS4, Steam, VLC, etc)
19. do any other favorite new install tweaks
20. take an Apple sticker from your girlfriends new MacBook Pro box and put it on the cheap plastic case of the Acer.

There you have it.  I will now take this to coffee shops and look cool.  NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW MY DIRTY SECRET.
