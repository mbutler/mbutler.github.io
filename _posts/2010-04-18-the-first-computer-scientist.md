> Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. &#8211; Edsger Dijkstra

The first computer scientist emerged in the late upper Paleolithic era around 40,000 &#8211; 10,000 years ago.  It&#8217;s, of course, facetious to call this person a scientist since science is a relatively recent invention.  However, this priest-astronomer had a knowledge of numerical sets, counting, tracking observable phenomena, and recording data.  This knowledge coincided with the first belief in an afterlife, burial rituals, and ancestor worship &#8211; but preceded the development of agriculture.  It&#8217;s known that these computer scientists tracked lunar cycles, paving the way for crop plantation and regular farming.
