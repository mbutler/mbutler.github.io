> By 1996, Licensing was keeping an in-house bible of reference materials as the volume of publications, facts, and figures grew to such unwieldy proportions that it became difficult to know everything relevant to a particular project. They finally decided something had to be done to organize the increasingly large collection of media which chronicled the *Star Wars* universe. A system of canon was developed that organized the materials into what was and wasn&#8217;t fit for the *Star Wars* story.

> In 2000, Lucas Licensing appointed Leland Chee to create a continuity tracking database referred to as the &#8220;[Holocron][1]&#8220;. As with every other aspect having to do with the overall story of *Star Wars*, the Holocron follows the canon policy that has been in effect for years.

> The Holocron is divided into 5 levels (in order of precedence): **G-canon**, **T-canon**, **C-canon**, **S-canon**, and **N-canon**.

I&#8217;ve added a new entry called B-canon.

B-canon is Butler canon; whatever was shown on HBO in the 1980&#8217;s, crap he made up in his mind with his toys (i.e. Bespin Cloud Car attacking Ewok Village for no reason), all his epic wins and losses in Battlegrounds, Monkeybacca selling Japanese tuna, Christmas specials, odd moments from other sci-fi shows that manages to sneak in, R2-D2 pendant pimpin&#8217;, but most importantly: what he THOUGHT the prequels were going to be.
