July 2006

There was a time, before 9/11, when you could leave and enter this country on nothing but a driver&#8217;s license and a smile. Back in &#8217;00, I backpacked and smiled my way down to the Southern-most part of Mexico to find the legendary beach of Zipolite. Maybe I watched The Beach one too many times or maybe I was looking for the perfect anti-Acapulco with Leonardo, but after several bus rides, cab rides, hitchhikes and hikes, I found the beach. 

I heard about Zipolite from a friend of a friend and decided I needed to visit this Shangri-La, no-law, clothing-optional paradise. Forget Cabo San Lucas and it&#8217;s two-week, drunk, spring-break crowd, I was looking for a real change in my reality &#8212; and I found it. Most of Zipolite&#8217;s inhabitants hailed from South America, Germany, Sweden, Mexico, or somewhere else. This was a place to live for a while. The nudity was certainly awkward at first but after a few days of living on the beach, it became a part of life. Living on the beach meant renting a hammock for two dollars per night or a cabana for six. After a few nights of bonfires, music, tuna pizza, and dangerous riptides, we all became close, if only temporary friends. That&#8217;s when I met John. 

John was an American, though he seemed like he belonged to Mexico. Most of his days were spent surfing the murderous waves at the beach, drinking juice and Mezcal, and fighting with his girlfriend. A lot of people have died at Zipolite, but John told me how to beat the tide. It was all a myth, he said. &#8220;Everyone is scared&#8221;. I never went in over my head, but I knew that if I got sucked out to sea all I had to do was swim parallel to shore. Sometimes I wished I could get swept down the coast to the little Shambala commune built into the cliff. I heard from John that it was built in the 60&#8217;s, and rarely used today. 

I walked the two miles down the beach and up the hand-carved staircase to the abandoned temple. The dwellings were all uninhabited and the prayer area was empty. I became scared on top of the cliff overlooking the Pacific, so I snapped one single shot on my five dollar 3-D camera I picked up at Osco a month before. The abstract blue sea photo is the only photographic proof I have of Zipolite to this day. Later that week, I ran into John again. I never grew tired of watching him peel foil from the lid of the small plastic juice bottles that he could buy for a peso. He would take a quick drink then would top off the container with his Mezcal. Mezcal is a hallucinogenic drink, like absinthe. Get drunk enough and you&#8217;ll start seeing things. But that day John was more intersested in scissors. Scissors are a versatile tool. Betther than a knife, he claimed. You could cut in so many different ways with a pair of scissors. He hadn&#8217;t seen any scissors for about three years so I gave him mine. It was nearing the end of my trip and I hadn&#8217;t even considered my scissors until now. Live on the beach for a month, and you don&#8217;t need to sew. Live on the beach for a year, and it&#8217;s a way to keep your clothes together. I gave John the utensil and considered it even for the surf lessons and lore. 

A couple of years later I heard from some friends that John got deported. Supposedly he landed back into America in New York harbor on the morning of September 11, 2001. 

&#8220;Everyone is scared&#8221; I reminded myself.
