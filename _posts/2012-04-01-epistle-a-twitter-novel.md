[Reading, Ivan Kramskoy. 1863]

Four minor characters from 19th century epistolary novels break free on twitter and converse with each other as well as any other person who engages with them. A new work of collaborative fiction between bots and real people. @MrsJewkes (Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded), @SergeantCuff (The Moonstone), @FredericaVernon (Lady Susan), and the bot/human hybrid @CaptainWalton (Frankenstein/Matthew Butler).

Originally developed during the 2012 Iowa City (UNESCO City of Literature) The Humanities and Technology Camp. 

[Fiction bots] tweet individual sentences from source text, listening and responding in a network of autonomous character-writers.
