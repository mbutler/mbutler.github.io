Upon returning from a late night celebration for Mr. Clark, Melody and I proceeded to make our way to the basement.  That is when she spotted it.

&#8220;Have you ever seen this before?&#8221; She was pointing to an eldritch lock on the basement door, previously unknown to either one of us.  It was placed at a peculiar distance from the floor and at a strange angle for a functioning lock.  I examined it closer and did not like what I made of it.  When I pressed my fingers against the hoary metal, a chill ran up my spine and gave me a fright.  It was queer that after living in that house for some time neither of us would have seen the quite observable lock before this moment.  It was as if it was placed there for that very night.

And then the horror struck.  The lock was not on the inside of the door, accessible from the basement.  It was on the outside.

&#8220;This lock was meant to keep someone from escaping the basement.&#8221;
