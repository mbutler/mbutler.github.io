Funded by an innovation grant written by Colleen Theisen, I built this touchscreen kiosk using the turn.js library, iPad 2, and LiliTab hardware. The ZineScreen is based loosley on the [Zine Machine], housed in the University Main Library. It consumes scanned zines and alternative publications as content in a [mobile application] and serves as a kiosk in various Special Collections exhibits. This version displayed issues of Poetry Comics, The Garlic Press, Fragile, and others.
