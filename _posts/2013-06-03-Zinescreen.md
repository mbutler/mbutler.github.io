A project funded by an innovation grant written by Colleen Theisen, librarian at the University of Iowa Libraries. I built this touchscreen kiosk using [turn.js], the iPad 2, and LiliTab hardware. The ZineScreen is based loosely on the [Zine Machine], housed in the University Main Library. ZineScreen consumes scanned zines and alternative publications as content in a [mobile application] and serves as a kiosk in various Special Collections exhibits. This version displayed issues of Poetry Comics, The Garlic Press, Fragile, and others.
