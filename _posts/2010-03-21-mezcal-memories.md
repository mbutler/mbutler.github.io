The thoughts leading *out* of the Mezcal mention lead me to a dusty corner of the old [memory palace][2].  I was bumming at Playa Zipolite January 2001.  This was pre-9/11 and I left the country with only a Driver&#8217;s License &#8212; something that absolutely could not happen today.  The destination was Oaxaca.   Zipolite was a flight, a busride, a cab ride, and a hike away.  If you timed it just right you&#8217;d make it just as the sun was rising over the southern most tip of Mexico.  It&#8217;s a clothing optional hippie community in the San Pedro Pochutla municipality and one of the most relaxing places on Earth (citation needed).

I&#8217;d run out of money. I had to hike over to Puerto Angel to access a bank account (it worked) but spent a few days first talking to a guy by the name of John (also from the States) who had been living at Zipolite for several years.  He spent his time surfing and drinking Mezcal.  You can buy Mezcal in Oaxaco con gusano (with the worm) and John&#8217;s favorite drink was Mezcal and Fresca mixed in a Little Hug juice bottle.  The man owned next to nothing but was willing to trade nearly anything for the pair of sharp fabric scissors I had with me.

I&#8217;m not sure how true this is, but Mezcal hangovers are supposedly hallucinatory.  There were many hallucinogens available on that beach, Mezcal being the most unreliable I&#8217;m sure.  But I was reading a book I&#8217;d found at a thrift store right before leaving for Mexico and **it** was the thing blowing my mind.  I couldn&#8217;t put it down and it came to color every memory I have of that Mexico trip.  [The Crack in the Cosmic Egg: New Constructs of Mind and Reality][3] is  about how language structures our our perception of reality, a concept that wasn&#8217;t new to me but presented at just the right time in just the right way.

Finding that book, reading it on a dangerous beach where people are routinely swept out to sea by the undertow, exploring the empty [Gloria&#8217;s Shambhala][4], hiking into the rural mountains to find treasure, and being surrounded by shamans and pseudo-shamans come flooding back when I think of Mezcal.

Thanks, Craig!
